# ai-memory - Design Decisions (Synthesis)

> Distills the four research reports (`research-*.md`) and three issue-tracker
> reports (`issues-*.md`) into the concrete decisions this project will make.
> Read this first; the research files are the receipts.

## 1. Product shape

A self-contained Rust binary that:

1. Runs as an **MCP server** (stdio + HTTP/SSE) for coding-agent CLIs (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, OpenCode, future).
2. Captures the agent's session **automatically** - no `write_note` ceremony - via hook scripts that the agent CLIs invoke (Claude Code lifecycle hooks, Codex hooks, OpenCode equivalents). Optional transcript-tail fallback for agents without hook APIs.
3. Maintains a **Karpathy-style wiki**: incrementally-compiled markdown pages with cross-links, supersession, an `index.md` and a `log.md`.
4. Serves retrieval via the MCP `tools/list` to coding agents: a handful of *narrow* tools, not 50.
5. Ships a **Docker image** (`docker run -v ai-memory-data:/data -p 49374:49374 ai-memory`) so it can move between desktop and homelab.
6. Is *self-healing*: schema migrations on startup, vector-index dim/provider check, write-ahead durability, periodic integrity audit, single-writer queue to avoid `database is locked`.

## 2. Hard requirements (extracted from the prompt)

- Rust, clean architecture, modular, unit-tested.
- Cargo-format clean.
- Docker-deployable, easy backup, easy move desktop↔homelab.
- MCP server for coding agents.
- **Automatic** memory capture/fetch - minimal manual tool invocations.
- Differentiates **short-term** vs **long-term** memory temporally (like agentmemory).
- Self-healing memory management.
- Helps with handoffs between agent CLIs (resume from Codex where Claude Code left off).
- Iteratively planned - each feature working before the next starts. No dead code.

## 3. Storage model - the biggest architectural decision

Three options surveyed:

| Option | Source-of-truth | DB used for | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A. DB-primary** | SQLite | Everything | Single transaction boundary, fast search, no FS race conditions | Opaque to humans; harder backup story |
| **B. Markdown-in-git** primary | Files in repo | Derived index | Diff-able, grep-able, portable, Karpathy-faithful | Watcher correctness (basic-memory #580/#758/#798), inode races (#765), startup cost |
| **C. DB-primary with on-demand export** | SQLite | Everything | Best of both | Two formats to keep coherent; user must remember to export |

**Decision: Option B - markdown in a git repo is source of truth, SQLite is derived index.**

**Why:**
- Backup/move story is trivial - `git clone` or `rsync` a directory. The user explicitly asked for this.
- Karpathy's pattern *is* the wiki on disk. Faking it with an export step loses the inspect-in-Obsidian property.
- DB is rebuildable from files - corruption is recoverable.
- Cross-tool compatibility for free: any agent that reads `~/.ai-memory/wiki/*.md` works without an MCP integration.

**How we avoid basic-memory's watcher pain:**
- Watcher has a heartbeat + reconciliation pass (full diff every 30s to catch missed events).
- We *own* writes through the MCP server's `wiki_write` path; the watcher is a *safety net* for external edits, not the primary input.
- Inode-locking advisory + psutil-style live-process check before destructive ops (`reset`, `purge`). Lesson from basic-memory #765/#776.
- Hidden-directory paths handled explicitly (basic-memory #798).

**How we avoid the "files-and-DB drift" overhead:**
- DB stores `(path, mtime, size, sha256, indexed_at, provider, model, dim)` per page. On startup, fast scan vs. cached SHAs; only changed files re-parsed.
- Embeddings keyed by `sha256(content) + provider + model + dim`. Re-embed only when content changes.

## 4. Database choice - single SQLite file

**Decision: one SQLite file with FTS5 + `sqlite-vec` extension + JSON columns for graph edges.**

Why not Postgres/pgvector? Cognee's #2717 and basic-memory's #830/#831 show Postgres is a real-deployment-only pain. v1 ships embedded.

Why not LanceDB/Qdrant/Kuzu/CozoDB/SurrealDB?
- LanceDB: cognee #2702/#2720 (file-format drift, filter propagation failures). Pyarrow underneath.
- Kuzu / Ladybug: cognee #2098/#2768 (upstream archived, fork-risk realized).
- CozoDB: small bus factor.
- SurrealDB: heavy, multi-mode storage; we'd inherit a lot of surface we don't need.
- Embedded `sqlite-vec` is well-maintained, single dependency, fits in one file with FTS5 + relational tables.

**The graph is just SQL tables.** A `wiki_pages` table, a `wiki_links (from_id, to_id, link_type)` table, optional `wiki_concepts (page_id, concept)`. Graph queries are recursive CTEs in SQLite. Petgraph in-memory for batch traversals. Avoids the entire "embedded graph DB" footgun cognee fell into.

**Crates** (research-backed picks):
- `rusqlite` + `rusqlite-extension` for sqlite-vec loading. `bundled-sqlcipher` if we want encryption later.
- `sqlx` for migrations (`sqlx::migrate!`). Async, type-checked.
- `tantivy` *not* used initially - sqlite FTS5 is sufficient at the corpus sizes we expect (hundreds to low-thousands of pages per project). Revisit only if FTS5 ranking proves inadequate.
- `petgraph` for in-memory graph algorithms during consolidation.

## 5. Embedding & LLM

**Embeddings:**
- Default: **local model via `ort` (ONNX Runtime) crate or `fastembed-rs`** running `bge-small-en-v1.5` (384 dim) or `bge-small-en-v1.5-q` quantized. Same model basic-memory uses.
- Persist `{provider, model, dim}` next to every vector. Refuse to load on mismatch with clear remediation (agentmemory #469 lesson).
- Cache path: `<data_dir>/models/`, never `/tmp` (basic-memory #741).
- Trait-based: `trait Embedder { ... }` with implementations `LocalOrtEmbedder`, `OpenAIEmbedder`, `VoyageEmbedder`. User configures one.

**LLM for consolidation passes:**
- **Off by default**, behaves like agentmemory after #138's fix. Without a provider, the system still works: synthetic compression (rule-based), no LLM-generated summaries, no `memory_consolidate` page-rewrite.
- With a provider, scheduled consolidation runs (1× per session-end + optional 6h timer).
- Provider trait `LlmProvider { complete(...); complete_structured(...) }`. Implementations: `AnthropicProvider`, `OpenAIProvider`, `OllamaProvider`, `OpenAICompatProvider`.
- **Native HTTP per provider** - no LiteLLM-equivalent. The cognee tracker (#2412/#2430/#2537/#2608/#2749/#2782/#2840/#2842) showed silent-kwarg-drop in a generic gateway is the #1 source of provider bugs. Each provider's typed JSON, errors on unknown fields. Hand-coded but correct.
- **Structured output via JSON schema, not XML, not Instructor-style wrapping.** Use each provider's native JSON-mode where available; for Anthropic, request a tool-use response with a typed schema. Validate with `serde_json` + `schemars`-derived schemas.

## 6. Capture model - auto, never `write_note`

Three capture surfaces, in priority order:

1. **Lifecycle hooks/extensions** (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, OMP). These are fast, reliable, structured. We ship hook scripts or generated TypeScript integrations the user installs once. Lessons from agentmemory:
  - Hooks must be **fire-and-forget** (#221). No `await fetch()` blocking session start.
  - Sub-second hard timeouts on the writer side (`tokio::time::timeout`).
  - All hooks → single HTTP/Unix-socket POST → server queues → returns 202 immediately.
  - Privacy strip at the hook boundary, not later (agentmemory `stripPrivateData`).

2. **Transcript tail** (universal fallback). Watch `~/.claude/projects/`, `~/.codex/`, `~/.config/opencode/sessions/`. Lossier but works for any agent. Required for the basic-memory #669/#687/#730 demand the tracker has been asking for.

3. **Manual MCP tool** (`memory_remember`) - only for ad-hoc explicit captures from the user ("remember this"). Not the primary path; not what the agent reaches for by default.

## 7. Memory model (temporal)

Adopt agentmemory's tier model **but** keep the surface narrow:

| Tier | What it is | Lifetime | Decay |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Working** | Current session: last N observations, last user prompt, current files | Until session end | Drop on session end (kept in DB for forensics, but excluded from default recall) |
| **Episodic** | Per-session summaries with concept tags, files-touched, decisions made | 30 days hot, 180 days cold, then evict if cold-score < threshold | Salience × exp(-λΔt) + Σ(σ/days_since_access) - agentmemory's formula, validated |
| **Semantic** | Distilled facts/preferences/architecture notes - the wiki pages themselves | Indefinite, supersedeable | Versioned in place: old `is_latest=false`, new `supersedes=old_id` |
| **Procedural** | Repeated patterns extracted from episodic clusters (`pattern` type with frequency ≥ 2) | Indefinite | Frequency-decay if not re-observed in N days |

**Implementation note:** the four tiers map to one `pages` table with a `tier` enum column + an `observations` table for raw working/episodic, not four separate tables. Keeps schema migrations sane.

## 8. Consolidation (the Karpathy bit)

Three scheduled MCP operations:

- **`memory_ingest`** (auto-called by hooks): one observation → write-fan-out to ~5–15 wiki pages. New page if no match; supersede + version if the page already exists. No-LLM fallback: append to a per-day digest page if no provider configured.
- **`memory_query`** (called by agent on demand): hierarchical - search `index.md` first, then page-level FTS+vector, then optional graph-walk expansion. RRF-fused. Agentmemory hit 95.2% R@5 with this pattern.
- **`memory_lint`** (scheduled hourly + on session-end): scans for contradictions, orphan pages, broken links, stale claims, low-confidence + zero-reinforcement entries. Pure LLM with strict JSON output.

Decay/forget runs as a separate `memory_forget_sweep` job: applies the retention formula; soft-deletes via `is_latest=false` + `superseded_at`; hard-deletes only after 180 days *and* zero accesses. Never silently destroys anything user-pinned.

## 9. Cross-agent handoff

A first-class typed protocol, shared state:

```rust
struct Handoff {
    from_agent: String,   // "claude-code", "codex"
    to_agent: Option<String>,
    project_id: ProjectId,
    cwd: PathBuf,
    summary: String,
    open_questions: Vec<String>,
    files_touched: Vec<PathBuf>,
    next_steps: Vec<String>,
    model: String,
    created_at: DateTime,
}
```

MCP tools `memory_handoff_begin` (writes a handoff page tagged `state=open`) and `memory_handoff_accept` (acknowledges, returns the handoff content, marks `accepted_by`). The user can stop Claude Code, start Codex, and Codex's session-start hook fetches the latest open handoff for the cwd.

agentmemory has this informally (`/handoff` skill); we make it explicit from day one because every research report flagged cross-agent as the v0.1 weak spot.

## 10. MCP tool surface - narrow on purpose

basic-memory has ~25 tools, agentmemory has 53. Both have user confusion as a result. Ship **at most 10 v1 tools**:

| Tool | Purpose | Annotation |
|---|---|---|
| `memory_remember` | Manual capture (rare) | destructive, idempotent |
| `memory_query` | Search + retrieve, auto-routed | read-only |
| `memory_recent` | Recent activity, optionally for-this-project | read-only |
| `memory_handoff_begin` | Mark session boundary, write handoff | destructive |
| `memory_handoff_accept` | Fetch+ack open handoff | destructive |
| `memory_forget` | Explicit user forget | destructive |
| `memory_session_summary` | Internal - used by stop hook | destructive (internal) |
| `memory_consolidate` | Internal - used by scheduler | destructive (internal) |
| `memory_lint` | Internal - used by scheduler | destructive (internal) |
| `memory_status` | Health, counts, last-consolidation-at | read-only |

Internal tools are gated by `tools/list` annotation; agents see only the user-visible ones unless `expose=all` is set. Every tool has MCP `readOnlyHint`/`destructiveHint`/`idempotentHint` (basic-memory pattern; lesson from #818 - be careful with `bool | None` aliases on tool params).

Tool param aliases: accept `query|q|search`, `project|workspace`, `dir|directory` - basic-memory's `AliasChoices` pattern works for LLM resilience.

## 11. Identity & project scoping (3-tuple from day one)

Lesson from basic-memory's v0.20 trauma: `(workspace, project, page_path)`. Even if v1 ships single-workspace, the schema and every API/tool param encodes the full 3-tuple. No retrofits.

Project resolution chain: explicit param → server's default → cwd-based heuristic (match repo root) → error.

## 12. Operability

- **Single binary**, statically-linked where possible. Distroless Docker image. **Absolute data path** by default (`dirs::data_local_dir().join("ai-memory")`); log it loudly on startup (agentmemory #303 lesson).
- **Atomic config**: one `Config::load()` → typed struct, every reader takes `&Config`. No `process.env` double-read paths (agentmemory #456/#469).
- **Write durability**: every observation lands in SQLite *and* is appended to a `log.md` line *before* the hook gets its 202. No background-task indexing-after-return (basic-memory #763/#578/#839).
- **Migrations**: `sqlx::migrate!` runs on startup; never inline DDL (basic-memory #727).
- **Schema versioning**: one source of truth for the schema; derived clients/docs. No "update 7 files" checklists (agentmemory AGENTS.md smell).
- **Backup/move**: `ai-memory export <dir>` dumps wiki/ + sqlite snapshot. `ai-memory import <dir>` consumes. Default data dir is portable. Optional: `auto_git_commit = true` config flag → commits the wiki directory on every `memory_lint` run.
- **Self-healing**: startup checks (`memory_diagnose`): vector dim/provider drift, FTS index corruption, orphan pages, broken links, zombie sessions. `memory_heal` auto-fixes the safe subset.
- **Logging**: structured `tracing` with rotating files, capped at N MB. No feedback loops (agentmemory #519).

## 13. What we are explicitly NOT doing in v1

To stay scoped:

- No multi-tenant auth/RBAC (single-user homelab).
- No web UI / dashboard (use `sqlite3` + `glow`/Obsidian).
- No Postgres backend (revisit if a real homelab user hits scale walls).
- No remote/cloud sync (use git remote on the wiki dir).
- No alternative embedded vector backends (sqlite-vec only).
- No alternative graph DB (SQL recursive CTEs only).
- No multimodal (text only).
- No "skills" / slash-command bundle in v1 (agentmemory plugin format) - focus on hooks + MCP first.
- No LongMemEval-style benchmark harness in v1 - add in v0.4.

## 14. Mistakes-to-avoid checklist (from issue research)

Top-line rules carved into the codebase:

1. One config-read path (agentmemory #456/#469).
2. Indexes in the same txn as the source-of-truth row (agentmemory #204/#309, basic-memory #763/#578).
3. JSON-schema structured outputs, no XML (agentmemory #492/#539; cognee #2840).
4. Hooks fire-and-forget (agentmemory #221, #143).
5. No background-task index-after-return; either sync or `index_status: pending` (basic-memory #763).
6. 3-tuple identity from day one (basic-memory #783/#834).
7. Vector index records `{provider, model, dim}`; refuse on mismatch (agentmemory #469).
8. Embedding cache path absolute, not `/tmp` (basic-memory #741).
9. Watcher heartbeat + reconciliation pass (basic-memory #580/#758/#798).
10. Live-process check before destructive ops (basic-memory #765).
11. Per-provider typed HTTP client; no LiteLLM equivalent (cognee #2840).
12. Idempotent ingest with deterministic id derivation (cognee #2510/#2557/#2633).
13. Single transactional boundary; no implicit graph/vector/relational sync (cognee Section B).
14. Filter propagation tests (cognee #2720 was a recall correctness bug).
15. Default data dir is an absolute canonical platform path (agentmemory #303).
16. No `lru_cache` on configs (cognee #2228/#2853).
17. Datasets/projects are query-time filters, not orchestration-mode-conditional (cognee #2867).
18. LLM has off by default; opt-in via env (agentmemory #138/#143).
19. `cargo deny` for transitive license audits (cognee #2807 - FastEmbed removed for license).
20. Pin upstream native deps; ship a lockfile (agentmemory #555/#540).
