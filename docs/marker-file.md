# Marker file: `.ai-memory.toml`

Declare which workspace (and optionally which project) an agent's
`cwd` belongs to, without depending on the directory's basename.

## Why

ai-memory namespaces every wiki page by `(workspace, project)`. By
default, `workspace = "default"` and `project = basename($cwd)`. That
works for a solo developer in `~/projects/<repo>` but breaks down
for the cases this marker file is built for:

- **Multi-client consultancies** with `~/projects/<client>/<repo>` —
  every client should land in a dedicated workspace, not "default".
- **Work / personal / open-source separation** for solo developers
  who want isolation by life context.
- **Mono-repos** where you'd like all packages under one project
  (instead of basename-of-each-package buckets) — or each package
  under its own project, your call.

The marker file lets you declare these mappings without forking
ai-memory or running CLI commands per directory.

## Where to put it

`.ai-memory.toml` in **any ancestor** of your `cwd`. Lifecycle hooks
walk up from `cwd` toward `$HOME` (or `/` if `$HOME` is unset) and
use the **first** marker found. Closer markers override outer ones. When
a marker is found, hook scripts also forward the current `cwd` so
workspace-only markers can still resolve `project = basename(cwd)` for
handoff lookups.

The marker path is shared by the POSIX/PowerShell hook scripts and the
generated OpenCode / OMP TypeScript integrations. In all cases, hook
capture and handoff lookup send the same `cwd`, `workspace`, `project`,
and `project_strategy` query params to the server when a marker is
present.

## Schema

```toml
# Required.
workspace = "movvia"

# Optional. When present, forces project = "pe-portais" for every
# cwd inside this marker's tree. Omit it to let basename(cwd) drive
# the project name.
project = "pe-portais"

# Optional. Omit it to preserve project = basename(cwd). Set it to
# "repo-root" to derive project from the main git repository root, so
# linked worktrees and subdirectories share one project. Ignored when
# `project` is present.
project_strategy = "repo-root"
```

**Naming rules** for `workspace` and `project`, validated server-side:

- Lowercase ASCII, digits, dots, dashes, underscores
- Regex: `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]*$`

Anything else is rejected at `get_or_create_workspace` / `_project`
time, surfacing as a hook warning. The shell helper URL-encodes
defensively but the server's regex is the source of truth.

`project_strategy` accepts `repo-root` (or `repo_root`) only. Unknown
values are ignored and behave like the default `basename(cwd)` strategy.

## Four canonical examples

### Multi-client

```
~/projects/movvia/.ai-memory.toml     → workspace = "movvia"
~/projects/cliente-x/.ai-memory.toml  → workspace = "cliente-x"
~/personal/.ai-memory.toml            → workspace = "personal"
```

Outcome:

- `~/projects/movvia/pe-api-core` → workspace = `movvia`, project = `pe-api-core`
- `~/projects/cliente-x/api`      → workspace = `cliente-x`, project = `api`
- `~/personal/blog`               → workspace = `personal`, project = `blog`

### Mono-repo with grouped packages

```
~/projects/movvia/.ai-memory.toml              → workspace = "movvia"
~/projects/movvia/pe-portais/.ai-memory.toml   → workspace = "movvia"
                                                  project   = "pe-portais"
```

Outcome:

- `~/projects/movvia/pe/pe-api-core`        → workspace = `movvia`, project = `pe-api-core`
- `~/projects/movvia/pe-portais/apps/web`   → workspace = `movvia`, project = `pe-portais`
  (closer marker wins)

### Git worktrees / repo-root identity

```
~/projects/ai-memory/.ai-memory.toml → workspace        = "oss"
                                      → project_strategy = "repo-root"
```

Outcome:

- `~/projects/ai-memory`                → workspace = `oss`, project = `ai-memory`
- `~/projects/ai-memory/crates/cli`     → workspace = `oss`, project = `ai-memory`
- `~/projects/ai-memory-feature-branch` → workspace = `oss`, project = `ai-memory`

Without `project_strategy = "repo-root"`, those same paths keep the
default behavior and resolve by their current directory basename.

### Single workspace, no per-repo overrides

```
~/.ai-memory.toml → workspace = "home"
```

Every cwd under `$HOME` lands in workspace `home` with
`project = basename(cwd)`. Useful when you just want to opt out of
the `default` bucket entirely.

## Migrating existing projects

Projects already created under workspace `default` stay there. Move
one with the CLI:

```sh
ai-memory rename-project \
    --workspace default --project foo \
    --new-workspace movvia
```

## What the marker file does NOT do

- ❌ No glob patterns. Walk-up by literal ancestry only.
- ❌ No merge of ancestor markers. Closest wins.
- ❌ No automatic migration of `default`-workspace projects.
- ❌ No automatic repo-root collapsing. Worktrees and subdirectories only
  share a project when `project_strategy = "repo-root"` is explicitly set.
- ❌ No env / auth / hook-url override. Use the existing env vars
  (`AI_MEMORY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `AI_MEMORY_HOOK_URL`) for those.

## Troubleshooting

**My marker isn't being picked up.** Walk through:

1. File is named exactly `.ai-memory.toml` (note the leading dot).
2. File is in an **ancestor** of the cwd — not a sibling, not a
   descendant.
3. There isn't a closer marker overriding it. Run
   `find ~/projects -maxdepth 5 -name '.ai-memory.toml'` to see all
   markers in your tree.
4. The workspace / project values match the regex above (lowercase
   alphanumerics, dots, dashes, underscores).
5. If you use `project_strategy`, it is exactly `repo-root`.

Hook scripts run fire-and-forget by design, so they don't log on
success. To see what's actually being sent, run a hook script by
hand:

```sh
printf '{"cwd":"%s"}' "$PWD" \
  | sh ~/.local/share/ai-memory/hooks/claude-code/post-tool-use.sh
```

If the marker is being read, the curl line (visible with `set -x`
or in server logs) will include `&workspace=...` in the URL.
