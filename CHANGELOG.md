# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- New `ai-memory hook` subcommand emits one lifecycle event natively (reads
  the JSON payload from stdin, POSTs to `/hook`, GETs `/handoff` on
  `session-start`) without spawning a shell. On native Windows, Claude Code
  now defaults to the native hook command — measured ~3.5-5× faster per
  tool-call hook (~735 ms shell → ~150-205 ms native on an i7-6700HQ).
  Opt back into the previous Git Bash + `.sh` path with
  `AI_MEMORY_HOOK_PLATFORM=windows-bash`. See
  [`docs/windows.md`](docs/windows.md#native-hook-command-claude-code-on-windows)
  ([#84]).
- New `GET /favicon.ico` route on the web UI serves the same logo bytes as
  the header, so the browser tab carries an icon without an extra asset
  embed ([#79]).
- Thin-client CLI commands (`status`, `write-page`, `search`, `read-page`,
  `embed`, `lint`, `backup`, …) now respect the server's base-path mount
  via `AI_MEMORY_BASE_PATH` or the path component of `AI_MEMORY_SERVER_URL`
  (URL path wins), so deployments hosted behind a reverse proxy under a
  subpath stop 404'ing — including the container `HEALTHCHECK`
  (`ai-memory status`). Empty / unset means root mount, byte-identical to
  the prior behaviour ([#82]).

### Changed
- The embedded web UI ships a single transparent 768×768 PNG (~126 KB,
  down from a 992 KB JPEG mislabelled as PNG) used for both the header
  logo and the favicon. README branding stays on the existing
  light/dark pair via `<picture>` ([#79]).

### Fixed
- `install-hooks --apply` (and `ai-memory upgrade`, which calls it) now
  MERGES into per-event hook arrays instead of replacing them, so
  third-party hooks registered under the same event (e.g. a context-mode
  `SessionStart` guard) survive re-apply. ai-memory-owned entries are
  still swapped for the fresh ones; re-runs stay idempotent. Resolves
  #80 ([#83]).
- FTS5 searches for filenames carrying ASCII punctuation no longer error
  or silently miss. `current.md` (which used to surface
  `fts5: syntax error near "."`) and `ui-refresh` (which silently returned
  zero hits despite `follow-ups/ui-refresh-scroll-restoration.md` existing)
  both work end-to-end. Punctuated tokens are now quoted as both
  whole-form and split-form phrases, OR'd, to satisfy the asymmetry
  between the content tokenizer (`tokenchars '/_-'` keeps them inside
  tokens) and the path index (which pre-expands `/_-.` to spaces)
  ([#81]).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-05
### Added
- New `[auto_scope]` config block (`mode`, `session_ttl_secs`,
  `max_entries`) selects how the hook-published "currently active project"
  pointer is shared across concurrent MCP callers. The default `single` mode
  preserves the historical process-wide slot. Opt-in `per_session` keys the
  pointer by `session_id` to isolate concurrent agent runs of the same
  operator; opt-in `per_actor` keys by `(user, session_id)` to isolate
  across operators as well, pairing with multi-user mode where `user`
  comes from the `users` row that owns the bearer token. `per_actor`
  also keeps a user-only fallback slot so authenticated MCP requests
  from clients that cannot forward a session id do not inherit another
  user's latest project; same-user session isolation still requires a
  client/bridge that sends `X-Memory-Actor-Session-Id` or
  `Mcp-Session-Id` on MCP tool calls. Per-key entries carry an insertion
  timestamp and are TTL-evicted (default 1 hour) and
  capped (default 4096) so adversarial / runaway clients cannot grow the
  map without bound. Both opt-in modes still publish to the single slot
  in parallel, so any caller without actor context falls back gracefully
  to the most recent project rather than an empty pointer. All MCP read
  tools (`memory_query`, `memory_recent`, `memory_read_page`,
  `memory_status`, `memory_briefing`, `memory_explore`, `memory_lint`,
  `memory_forget_sweep`, `memory_handoff_*`) now thread the request's
  `ActorContext` into scope resolution, so opt-in isolation takes effect
  for the full read surface.

### Fixed
- Claude Code lifecycle hooks now emit structured JSON on stdout. Fire-and-
  forget hooks return `{}`, and `SessionStart` wraps pending handoff text in
  `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`, avoiding Claude Code's repeated
  "Hook output does not start with {" debug spam while preserving handoff
  injection.
- `POST /admin/rename-project` now returns `404 Not Found` when the project row
  has been deleted (typically by a concurrent `purge-project`) between the
  handler's id lookup and the writer's `UPDATE`. The pre-fix path silently
  responded `200 OK` with `pages: 0` for an operation that affected zero rows,
  which contradicted the concurrent purge's also-`200 OK` destruction of the
  same project and gave operators no signal that the rename had been undone.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-04
### Added
- New `POST /admin/delete-page` HTTP endpoint deletes a single page with
  explicit `(workspace, project)`. Like `purge-project`/`rename-project`, it
  uses no-create lookup — a delete on a typo'd or wrong scope now returns
  `404 workspace 'X' not found` instead of silently auto-creating the
  container and returning misleading `deleted: true`.
- New `ai-memory delete-page --path <P> --workspace <W> --project <P>` CLI
  subcommand, a thin client of `/admin/delete-page`. Mirrors the
  write-page/read-page CLI shape so terminal users get a complete
  delete-single-page surface for the first time.
- New `memory_handoff_cancel` MCP tool marks an exact open handoff id expired,
  giving agents a safe way to discard a mistakenly-created pending handoff
  before the next session consumes stale context.

### Fixed
- MCP tool descriptions and routing snippets now draw a sharper boundary
  between read-only `memory_briefing` and session-ending
  `memory_handoff_begin`, reducing accidental dangling handoffs when an agent
  was only asked for project status.
- Custom `--web-ui-dir` SPAs mounted at a non-root `--web-slug` now serve the
  injected shell at the trailing-slash root too (for example `/web/`), matching
  `/web` and deep client routes instead of returning a refresh-only 404.
- OpenCode and OMP generated hooks now derive `project_strategy = "repo-root"`
  project names from the host-visible `.ai-memory.toml` marker directory before
  sending hook payloads, so dockerized servers no longer fall back to git
  discovery inside paths they cannot see.
- `memory_delete_page` (MCP) now accepts `workspace` alongside `project` and
  routes scope through `effective_ids_for_read_args`, the same path the read
  tools use. Previously a project name that lived in multiple workspaces
  could silently route the delete to the wrong slot and return `deleted:
  true` for a page that was never touched. Operators on shared (multi-
  workspace) servers should explicitly pass `workspace + project` to make
  the target unambiguous.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-02
### Added
- `openai-compat` LLM providers can now opt into strict JSON Schema structured
  output with `AI_MEMORY_LLM_COMPAT_STRICT=true`. Strict mode sends
  `response_format=json_schema` first for compatible Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio,
  llama.cpp, and gateway endpoints, while the tolerant JSON-object parser
  remains the default and the fallback for strict raw-call failures ([#70]).
- The read-only web browser now renders `[[wiki links]]` as clickable internal
  links to the target page. Supports `[[path]]`, `[[path|label]]`,
  `[[project:path]]`, and `[[workspace/project:path]]`, resolved against the
  current page's project unless the target carries its own scope; bare targets
  get a `.md` suffix. External schemes, path traversal, and links inside fenced
  or inline code are left as literal text ([#68]).
- `ai-memory serve --transport http` can host the entire HTTP surface under a
  configurable subpath with `--base-path` / `AI_MEMORY_BASE_PATH`; `/mcp`,
  `/hook`, `/admin/*`, `/api/v1`, and the web UI all move under that prefix.
  The web UI mount can also be changed with `--web-slug`, and custom
  `--web-ui-dir` SPAs receive injected `<base href>` plus
  `ai-memory-base-path` metadata for same-origin API calls behind reverse
  proxies ([#65]).
- `ai-memory move-project` can move projects across workspaces via the admin
  API. Fresh destinations use a lossless true move that keeps the same
  `project_id`, sessions, observations, handoffs, embeddings, and page history;
  existing same-named destination projects use copy-purge merge with explicit
  `on_conflict` handling. Admission webhooks can subscribe to the new
  `move_project` event and receive destination names in the context ([#60]).
- Page FTS now indexes normalized page paths, so searches can find pages by
  filename or slug even when the slug does not appear in the title/body ([#62]).
- Admission webhooks can now observe, mutate, or reject engine write/delete/
  purge operations, with authenticated actor context, loop-prevention skip
  lists for trusted re-entry, and non-blocking observer webhooks for mirrors
  and backups ([#55]).
- New `memory_delete_page` MCP tool deletes a single page by exact path,
  updates the SQLite index directly, and fires `op=delete` admission hooks
  before removal ([#55]).

### Fixed
- Backups no longer dereference symlinks under `wiki/`, preventing a planted
  wiki symlink from pulling arbitrary readable host-file contents into
  `backup.tar.gz`.
- `ai-memory restore` now validates tar entries before extraction and accepts
  only regular files/directories under the expected backup paths
  (`wiki/`, `db/memory.sqlite`, and `config.toml`), rejecting links, special
  files, unsafe paths, and unexpected archive entries.
- In multi-user mode (`[auth].token_pepper` configured), operational
  `/admin/*` endpoints now require the root token; DB-user tokens receive
  403 while single-user installs keep the historical permissive admin behavior.
- LLM provider clients now cap provider response bodies before JSON, text, or
  SSE parsing, and truncate error bodies from bounded buffers instead of
  buffering arbitrary-size responses.
- Non-blocking admission webhooks now have a process-level in-flight cap and
  webhook timeouts are clamped to a safe maximum, preventing observer hooks
  from growing unbounded background work during write bursts.
- Hook cwd/project resolution caching is now bounded with LRU-style eviction,
  preventing unbounded process-lifetime growth from streams of unique cwd
  values.
- `memory_write_page` tool description and routing prompts now steer agents
  toward writing the page title as a `# H1` on the first line of `body` and
  omitting the `title` argument. ai-memory already auto-derived the title from
  `# H1` (or path stem) when `title` was missing — the change is documentation
  only, but it eliminates a known source of MCP `JSON parsing` errors when the
  LLM failed to escape quotes/colons in `title` ([#67]).
- Custom `--web-ui-dir` frontends no longer serve raw `/index.html` without
  base-path injection; direct index requests and SPA fallback routes now return
  the injected shell, while static assets remain untouched ([#65]).
- `move-project` true moves now run through a wiki mutation gate: normal
  page writes/reindexes validate the `(workspace_id, project_id)` pair before
  touching disk, while true moves hold the exclusive side across the directory
  rename and DB re-stamp. Stale old-workspace writes now fail without creating
  orphan files, and V18 aborts if existing split-brain rows are present ([#60]).
- `move-project` copy-purge conflict detection now treats body, frontmatter,
  title, tier, and pinned status as the page identity under `on_conflict=block`,
  preventing metadata-only overwrites from slipping through ([#60]).
- `memory_write_page` calls that specify `project` without `workspace` now
  default to the active workspace published by hooks, and project-only reads use
  the same active-workspace resolution so the write can be read back without an
  explicit workspace ([#61]).
- `memory_read_page` now accepts explicit `workspace` + `project` for sibling
  projects and falls back to the stored DB body only when the markdown file is
  missing, not when the disk source of truth is corrupt or unreadable ([#63]).
- `openai-oauth` now speaks the current ChatGPT/Codex responses stream format
  for bootstrap/consolidation requests and avoids sending the unsupported
  `max_output_tokens` field on that endpoint ([#64]).
- `ai-memory write-page` now resolves an omitted `--project` through the same
  current-project heuristic as `read-page` and `search`, preventing writes from
  landing in `scratch` while the read-back targets the cwd-derived project
  ([#66]).

## [0.8.1] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- **Consolidation no longer fails on long sessions** (~5,000+ observations or
  multi-hour agent runs). Two bugs surfaced trying to consolidate a real
  16-hour / 7,234-observation session:
  - **Prompt confusion (regression from the v0.8 `slot_kind` work):** the
    multi-page consolidator prompt listed `slot_kind` values
    (`state` / `invariant`) immediately above the `tier` values
    (`working` / `episodic` / `semantic` / `procedural`). The LLM read them
    as one list and emitted `tier: "state"` in structured responses, which
    deserialisation rejected. Prompt now leads with `tier` (with explicit
    "EXACTLY ONE OF FOUR strings" emphasis), then `kind`, then `slot_kind`
    under its own clearly-scoped section that states "completely unrelated
    to tier" and "only for `_slots/*` paths."
  - **No token budget on the observation dump:** `build_request` and
    `build_batch_request_with_slots` dumped every observation into the
    prompt buffer, which exceeded the provider's 200k-token context on long
    sessions (the sabadell run produced a 235k-token request → 400 from
    the provider). New `window_observations_to_budget` walks the slice
    from most-recent backward, keeping each entry whose render cost fits
    in a 400k-char budget (~100k tokens), leaving room for the system
    prompt + schema + LLM output. When entries are skipped, a prepended
    note tells the LLM the context is partial so its summary doesn't
    pretend to cover the early session. Both `PreCompact` and
    `memory_consolidate` triggers benefit from the fix — both were silently
    failing into the `warn!()` catchall on sessions this long.
  - 5 unit tests guard the windowing invariants (empty input, fits-under-
    budget passthrough, most-recent-preserved, single-too-large-obs drops
    everything, observation-boundary alignment). No schema change, no
    config knob, backward-compatible for sessions that already fit.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- **Multi-user attribution (v0.8 Phase 1, rolling out across milestones
  P1.1–P1.8).** ai-memory's data model stays single-tenant — every
  authenticated request sees every page — but writes can now be
  attributed to a named user. Five `ai-memory user` subcommands
  (`add`, `list`, `expire`, `revive`, `rotate-token`) manage a `users`
  table; the auth middleware resolves every request to one of four
  tiers (Anonymous, Root, DB user, 401), injects an
  `Extension<ActorContext>` + `Extension<AuthLevel>` for downstream
  consumers, and gates the root-only admin user-management endpoints.
  Tokens are 32 bytes of OS CSPRNG, stored only as
  `SHA-256(token || ":" || token_pepper)` (per-server pepper from
  `[auth].token_pepper`, auto-generated on `ai-memory init`); see
  [`docs/users.md`](docs/users.md) for the SHA-256-not-argon2id
  rationale, the four-rung auth ladder, and the backward-compat
  migration for pre-v0.8 installs. New v0.8 fields on `[auth]`:
  `root_username` / `root_email` / `root_name` (label for the bearer
  token's writes) and `token_pepper`. Per-page `author_id` + web UI
  surfacing lands in P1.6/P1.7; this milestone set ships P1.1
  (`ActorContext` + `UserId` in core), P1.2 (table + writer/reader
  ops + V14 migration), P1.3 (auth middleware), P1.4 (root-gated
  `POST/GET /admin/users` + `…/expire|revive|rotate-token`), and P1.5
  (CLI subcommands). **No behaviour change for existing single-user
  installs**: without `[auth].token_pepper` the multi-user lookup
  stays dormant, user-management endpoints 503 with a clear
  `multi-user not enabled` message pointing at `ai-memory init`,
  and the existing `bearer_token`-only flow keeps authenticating
  exactly as before.
- **`memory_query { global: true }` — cross-project global search** that
  reaches every project in every workspace in one call, with each hit
  annotated by its workspace + project so the agent can tell where it
  came from. Use when the agent doesn't know which project holds a
  cross-cutting note (shared infra/ops, a sibling app). Mutually
  exclusive with `scopes`/`project`/`workspace`. Routing snippet +
  `MEMORY_INSTRUCTIONS` now teach both broadening modes (`scopes` for
  named siblings, `global=true` for unknown locations) and explicitly
  warn that `memory_query` returns snippets — use `memory_read_page`
  for full bodies. The prompt-surface contradiction the original PR
  shipped ("there is no global 'search everything' mode" right after
  the bullet advertising `global=true`) was caught in the post-merge
  audit and rewritten; the prompt regression test now refuses any
  variant of that legacy phrasing
  ([#56], thanks @djalmajr).
- **Cross-project wiki links + dependency graph.** Wikilinks gain an
  explicit scope qualifier: `[[project:path.md]]` for a sibling project
  in the same workspace, `[[workspace/project:path.md]]` for another
  workspace. Bare links are unchanged (resolve within the source's own
  project). `links.to_workspace` / `links.to_project` join the primary
  key so the same `to_path` can land in two different projects without
  colliding. `memory_lint` now reports dangling cross-project refs
  (typo'd project vs missing/renamed target page), `memory_briefing`
  exposes `cross_project_dependents` / `cross_project_dependencies`
  per project, and `GET /api/v1/graph` returns the resolved cross-
  project edges for a graph view. Migration V13 rebuilds the `links`
  table preserving existing rows as `(to_workspace=NULL,
  to_project=NULL)` — same "local" semantics as before
  ([#57], thanks @djalmajr).

### Changed
- **FTS5 queries OR-join bare multi-word inputs** instead of the
  pre-existing AND default. A natural-language query like
  `"have we discussed cross project search strategy"` previously
  required every word to co-occur in one page — near-zero recall for
  multi-word queries, which the caller silently mistook for "never
  recorded". OR + BM25 ranking (callers already `ORDER BY rank`) keeps
  the best-matching pages at the top of the list, so the user-visible
  top-N is still AND-ish; OR just adds a relevant tail instead of
  returning nothing. Explicit FTS5 syntax (`OR`/`AND`/`NOT`/`NEAR`,
  quoted phrases, parens) is detected and preserved verbatim so the
  exact-match escape hatch stays available. 5 new unit tests guard the
  preservation contract (post-merge audit). Migration V12 rebuilds the
  FTS tables with `unicode61 remove_diacritics 2` so accent-free
  Portuguese queries (`"descricao da sessao"`) match accented stored
  text (`"descrição da sessão"`); contentless FTS — source rows
  untouched ([#58], thanks @djalmajr).
- **MCP write tools now honour the session's project (and create
  named projects on demand).** Three correctness fixes on
  `memory_write_page` / `memory_lint` / `memory_forget_sweep`:
  - A `memory_write_page { project: "X" }` for a project name that
    doesn't exist used to silently fall through to the session's
    active project (find-only resolution); writes meant for a fresh
    project polluted the current one. A new `write_target_ids`
    helper uses **get-or-create** for an explicit project name, so
    a named write always lands where the agent asked.
  - `memory_lint` + `memory_forget_sweep` previously always targeted
    the server's baked `--project` regardless of the session, so a
    cross-project lint or retention sweep could never reach the
    project the user was actually working in. Both now resolve
    through the same find-only `effective_ids_for_read_args` path
    the read tools use, with the hook-published active project as
    the fallback.
  - Both `lint` / `sweep` and the new `write_page` add explicit
    `workspace` + `project` args (defaulted to current session,
    documented with the v0.5.2 "**Omit unless the user explicitly
    names a *different* project.**" tail). 2 regression tests cover
    "Bug B" (explicit-project write must create + land) and
    "Bug C" (sweep must evaluate the named project, not the baked
    default) ([#59], thanks @djalmajr).

## [0.7.1] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **`install-hooks --agent codex` no longer panics with `index not found`**
  when `~/.codex/config.toml` carries an `[mcp_servers]` table that has other
  MCP servers (context7, node_repl, …) but no `ai-memory` entry — a
  perfectly valid setup since ai-memory can integrate via hooks alone.
  `infer_codex_mcp_config` used `toml_edit`'s panicking `Index` impl with
  bare `[]` chains; it now walks the table via `.get()` and returns `None`
  on any missing key. Mirrors the safe pattern the JSON variant has used
  all along. Adds 4 regression tests covering missing-entry,
  missing-table, empty-doc, and bare-entry inputs
  ([#53], thanks @Otavio-Machado-Santos).
- **`install-hooks --agent claude-code` no longer silently stages 0 scripts
  and points `settings.json` at an empty directory.** On macOS — and any
  install where the binary lives outside the repo and the system package
  paths (`/usr/local/share`, `/usr/share`) are absent — `resolve_hooks_dir`
  fell through to the data-local candidate, which was *also* the staging
  destination. The wipe-then-copy flow inside `stage_hook_scripts_in` then
  deleted the very scripts it was about to read, leaving 0 copied; the
  caller proceeded to rewrite `settings.json` anyway, disabling capture
  with no error. The function now (a) canonicalizes source and destination
  paths, skips the wipe + copy when they match and verifies in-place,
  preserving any scripts a prior `setup-agent` run extracted there, and
  (b) bails with an actionable error pointing at `--hooks-dir` or
  `ai-memory setup-agent` whenever zero scripts are present in either
  branch. Adds 3 regression tests
  ([#52], thanks @Otavio-Machado-Santos).
- **macOS thin-client wrapper no longer crashes with "Permission denied" in
  the log file appender.** The `bin/ai-memory` wrapper passed
  `-u $(id -u):$(id -g)` to the one-shot helper container, which on macOS
  collides with the data volume owner (uid 1000 inside the container vs
  uid 501/502 on the host). The wrapper now skips `-u` on Darwin so the
  container runs as its default uid 1000 — Docker Desktop's file-sharing
  layer handles host ownership transparently — while Linux and other
  Unix systems continue to receive `-u`. Same change also hardens the
  `${TTY_ARGS[@]}` / `${NETWORK_ARGS[@]}` / `${ENV_ARGS[@]}` /
  `${USER_ARGS[@]}` expansions for `set -u` compatibility on macOS's
  default bash 3.2 ([#51], thanks @abnersajr; supersedes [#50]).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added
- **`memory_read_page` MCP tool** (`read-only`) for fetching the FULL body of a
  wiki page — pass `path` for a direct lookup or `query` to fetch the top FTS5
  hit's full body. Complements `memory_query`'s 24-word snippets when an agent
  needs to read an entire decision page end-to-end. Also exposed as
  `GET /admin/read-page?workspace=…&project=…&path=…` (admin HTTP) and the new
  `ai-memory read-page` CLI subcommand (thin HTTP client). All three surfaces
  scope to the current project by default and route user-supplied paths through
  `PagePath::new`, so traversal attempts (`../etc/passwd`) are rejected with
  400. ARCHITECTURE.md's MCP-tool table grows from 12 to 13 rows ([#49]).
- `_slots/*.md` pages can now declare `slot_kind: state` or
  `slot_kind: invariant` frontmatter. `state` remains the default for existing
  slots; `invariant` marks high-resistance project context or preferences that
  consolidation should not rewrite unless observations directly contradict the
  existing slot content ([#47], closes [#14]).

### Fixed
- **Windows PowerShell hooks no longer hang or stall the agent.** The shared
  `hooks/lib/ai-memory-hook.ps1` read stdin via `[Console]::In.ReadToEnd()`,
  which blocks indefinitely when the agent does not close the stdin pipe
  (observed on Claude Code `PreCompact`); because the `Invoke-WebRequest`
  timeout only starts after the read returns, a stuck read meant the hook
  never POSTed anything. Stdin is now read asynchronously, guarded by
  `[Console]::IsInputRedirected` with a 2s cap, so the hook can never freeze.
  HTTP timeouts were also raised from 1s to 3s (POST) / 2s (handoff GET) to
  tolerate remote servers over higher-latency links. The full raw payload is
  still forwarded (parity with `_lib.sh`), so observation title/body stay
  intact. Affects every agent still on the PowerShell hook runner
  (Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, OpenCode on Windows) ([#48]).
- Page upserts now treat frontmatter/title/tier/pinned changes as real page
  updates instead of short-circuiting solely on unchanged body text, keeping
  the SQLite index consistent with markdown frontmatter-only edits ([#47]).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-28

### Added
- `Cache-Control: private, max-age=N` headers on all `/api/v1` read endpoints
  (lists/search/recent/briefing/overview: 30–60s; single-page reads: 300s).
  Errors stay uncached. A polling SPA no longer hits the DB on every request.
- **ETag + conditional GET** on the single-page read endpoint
  (`GET /api/v1/workspaces/{ws}/projects/{p}/pages/{*path}`): the response
  carries `ETag: "<sha256>"` over the markdown body, and a follow-up request
  with matching `If-None-Match` returns `304 Not Modified` with no body.
- **`--cors-allow-origin`** flag (repeatable) and
  `AI_MEMORY_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS=a,b,c` env var. When set, a `CorsLayer` is
  attached **only to `/api/v1`** (`/mcp`, `/hook`, `/admin`, and `/web` are
  intentionally untouched) so a separately-hosted SPA can call the API. Each
  origin must include a scheme; `*` is rejected at startup (CORS spec forbids
  credentials + wildcard). Empty list = same-origin only, unchanged behaviour.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added
- Read-only **`/api/v1`** JSON surface for third-party frontends: workspaces,
  projects, pages (list + read with frontmatter, body, resolved links, and
  back-links), recent, briefing, search (GET single/global + POST multi-scope
  capped at 25 scopes), and workspace/project `overview` aggregates (handoff +
  briefing + memory-health drill-down). Mounted before the bearer +
  host-allowlist middleware so existing auth applies automatically. Read-only
  by construction — zero writer calls in the handlers ([#7]).
- **`--web-ui-dir`** flag on `ai-memory serve` to host any static SPA at
  `/web` (same origin as the API, behind the same auth), with `index.html`
  SPA fallback via `tower-http::ServeDir`. Validates the directory exists
  and contains `index.html` before binding. When the flag is absent, the
  built-in server-side `/web` browser stays the default ([#7]).
- MCP read tools (`memory_query`, `memory_recent`, `memory_status`,
  `memory_briefing`, `memory_explore`) accept optional `workspace` +
  `scopes` args for explicit multi-project queries; existing single-`project`
  behaviour is unchanged and remains the default ([#7]).
- New reader queries powering the API: per-page outgoing links + incoming
  back-links, workspace-aggregated briefing, memory-health (stale /
  duplicate / orphan) counts and drill-down lists, workspace summaries
  with last-update timestamps ([#7]).

### Fixed
- Antigravity `pre-tool-use` hook now emits the documented
  `{"decision":"allow"}` JSON contract instead of an empty `{}`, while
  keeping the `ai_memory_post_hook` call fully suppressed
  (`>/dev/null 2>&1 || true`) so the `queued` body never bleeds into the
  hook's stdout. Identical logic for `.sh` and `.ps1`; other hook scripts
  remain silent and unchanged ([#44], thanks @ArtroxGabriel).

### Docs
- New **[`docs/frontend-api.md`](docs/frontend-api.md)** integration guide
  for `/api/v1`: auth flow, response schemas (`PageHit`, `BriefingSnapshot`,
  `HealthDetail`, `PageLinks`, …), error model, limits/pagination,
  custom-UI hosting, a worked `fetch`/`curl` example, and pointers to the
  canonical source-of-truth files.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-05-28
### Added
- `ai-memory status` / `status --json` now includes passive process-scoped LLM
  and embedding provider health based on the last real provider call, without
  active probing or token spend ([#46]).

### Changed
- Agent-facing prompts (`MEMORY_INSTRUCTIONS`, the `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`
  routing snippet, and the per-tool `project`/`cwd` arg docstrings) now lead
  with a clear "default to the current project — do not pass `project` or
  `cwd` args unless the user names a *different* project" rule, plus a
  reminder that the SessionStart auto-fetched handoff block already covers the
  current project. Reduces cross-agent friction where a fresh agent surfaced
  the wrong project's handoff because the LLM over-eagerly passed scoping
  args. Doc-only, no behaviour change.

### Fixed
- Claude Code hook installs on native Windows now render Git Bash-compatible
  `bash -c` commands that keep the POSIX `.sh` hook scripts and convert
  drive-letter paths to Git Bash paths, matching Claude Code's actual hook
  runner instead of emitting PowerShell commands ([#45]).
- `ai-memory llm-test --provider anthropic-oauth` now parses and maps to the
  Anthropic OAuth provider instead of being rejected by clap ([#43]).

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-27
### Changed
- Docker release publishing now builds Linux x86_64 and aarch64 artifacts once,
  reuses those artifacts for Docker images, and smoke-tests both amd64 and arm64
  images after assembling the multi-arch manifest.
- The AUR `ai-memory-bin` package now supports aarch64 using the prebuilt Linux
  aarch64 release artifact.
- Docker source builds now use the vendored Tailwind CSS artifact, avoiding
  cross-architecture Tailwind CLI cache collisions during multi-arch releases.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-27
### Fixed
- Docker release images now publish both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`
  manifests, so Apple Silicon and ARM64 Linux hosts can pull the image without
  forcing x86 emulation ([#41]).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-27
### Added
- `anthropic-oauth` LLM provider: use a Claude Pro/Max subscription via
  `claude setup-token` instead of an API key. In-Rust, reuses the existing
  Anthropic Messages client (incl. structured output). **Unofficial and
  against Anthropic's usage policies — use at your own risk** (docs warn
  prominently).
- Opt-in `AI_MEMORY_CONSOLIDATE_ON_SESSION_END`: when set and an LLM provider
  is configured, SessionEnd additionally runs LLM consolidation on top of the
  always-written rule-based summary page (non-fatal on failure) ([#40]).

### Changed
- Docs recommend a small/fast model (Haiku/mini class) for the OAuth /
  subscription LLM backends — consolidation/lint/explore is summarisation, not
  hard reasoning, and small models are far easier on subscription rate limits.
- Aligned every prompt surface + doc with actual SessionEnd behavior: it always
  writes a rule-based summary page + handoff; LLM consolidation runs on
  PreCompact, on demand via `memory_consolidate`, and at session end only
  behind the new opt-in flag ([#40]).

### Fixed
- Windows own-write detection: `inode_of` now returns the real NTFS file index
  (was always `0`, which collapsed the watcher's own-write set) ([#37]).
- `ai-memory upgrade` no longer fails with `invalid value 'lib' for --agent` —
  the hook-refresh loop skips the shared `lib/` helper dir ([#38]).
- Native packaging CI now supports non-root runners whose `systemd-tmpfiles`
  lacks `--dry-run`, while still operating only inside a temporary alternate
  root.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-27
### Fixed
- AUR release publishing now runs with `HOME=/home/aurbuild` and an explicit
  `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`, so the workflow uses the configured AUR deploy key.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-27
### Changed
- Reissued the release after the initial AUR publish failure. This release was
  superseded by 0.3.2 for the AUR SSH home fix.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-27
### Added
- Arch Linux native packaging assets: source and prebuilt AUR package
  definitions, system/user systemd units, sysusers/tmpfiles entries, native
  config/env templates, CI-safe alternate-root packaging checks, and a manual
  disposable-distrobox integration harness for validating real service startup
  before publishing.
- Tag-triggered release automation now validates that `vX.Y.Z` matches
  `Cargo.toml`, publishes a native Linux release tarball, keeps Docker image
  publishing behind Docker Hub secrets, and optionally publishes both AUR
  package bases when `AUR_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` is configured.
- `memory_write_page` MCP tool for explicit durable annotations, so agents can
  write permanent wiki knowledge without abusing single-use handoffs.
- `openai-oauth` LLM provider for ChatGPT/Codex accounts, including
  `ai-memory auth login|logout|status` device-flow commands and token storage
  in `<data_dir>/auth.json`.
- `copilot` LLM provider for GitHub Copilot Chat accounts. It stores a GitHub
  token via `ai-memory auth login copilot`, exchanges it for a short-lived
  Copilot API token, and sends Copilot Chat requests with `vscode-chat`
  integration headers.

### Fixed
- `install-mcp`, `install-hooks`, and `setup-agent` now honor configured
  `AI_MEMORY_SERVER_URL` defaults; `install-hooks` also reuses an existing
  ai-memory MCP entry when present, preventing remote MCP setups from
  regenerating loopback-only lifecycle hooks during installs/upgrades.
- Filesystem watcher now reindexes a project when backends report only a
  parent-directory event, improving external editor capture on macOS/FSEvents.
- OpenAI strict structured-output schema normalization now strips generated
  `$ref` annotation siblings and rewrites generated enum `oneOf` schemas to
  `anyOf`, unblocking `memory_consolidate multi_page=true` on OpenAI models.
- OpenAI-compatible embedding calls now truncate oversized page bodies, surface
  provider errors returned in HTTP 200 bodies, retry bounded HTTP 429 responses,
  and may reuse `LLM_API_KEY` when a custom embedding base URL is configured.
- `ai-memory embed --force` without `--project` now re-embeds every project in
  the workspace and purges stale/superseded embedding rows in the same scope.
- Windows hook `cwd` values sent to a Linux server now resolve projects by the
  final path component instead of treating the full backslash path as the
  project name.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-26
### Added
- `ai-memory bootstrap` now prunes collected sources before POSTing to the
  server and supports `--chunk-input-tokens` to process large repositories via
  sequential LLM calls instead of one oversized prompt.
- Opt-in extension event metadata for `/hook`: custom integrations can
  pass `extension=<namespace>` (and optionally `source_event=<name>`) to
  preserve a validated third-party source event while storage keeps the
  canonical `ObservationKind` closed. Unknown events without an extension
  still collapse to `other` with no source-event metadata.
- `.ai-memory.toml` marker file lets a directory tree declare its
  `workspace` (required) and `project` (optional) without depending on
  `basename($cwd)`. Lifecycle hook scripts walk up from `cwd` to find
  the closest marker and forward `cwd` plus the declared names as
  query params on `POST /hook` and `GET /handoff`. Markers can also set
  `project_strategy = "repo-root"` to derive project identity from the
  main git repository root, so linked worktrees share one project. Server
  accepts the new params as optional overrides;
  absent marker means the previous behaviour (`workspace = "default"`,
  `project = basename(cwd)`) — fully backward compatible. See
  [`docs/marker-file.md`](docs/marker-file.md).
- Oh My Pi / OMP is now a first-class integration: `install-mcp --client pi`
  and `--client omp` write native `~/.omp/agent/mcp.json` config, while
  `install-hooks --agent omp` and `--agent pi` write the TypeScript extension
  used for lifecycle capture and handoff injection.
- Graph-aware retrieval: `memory_query` now combines FTS5, wikilink-neighbor
  expansion, optional vector RRF, and bounded raw-observation fallback.
- Observation FTS indexing and unresolved-link diagnostics surfaced through
  admin/CLI status paths.
- `_slots/` wiki pages are automatically pinned and surfaced in briefing /
  explore snapshots.
- Server-side scheduled maintenance for forget sweep and lint, with optional
  embedding backfill scheduling.
- Experimental native Windows support: PowerShell Docker wrapper,
  `ai-memory.cmd`, `.ps1` lifecycle hooks in parity with `.sh` hooks, Windows
  Tailwind hash/download support, and [`docs/windows.md`](docs/windows.md).
- Google Gemini LLM provider via `AI_MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=gemini`, with
  `gemini-2.5-flash` as the default hosted Google model and `GEMINI_API_KEY`
  / `GOOGLE_API_KEY` support.
- Google Gemini embeddings via `AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=google` or
  `gemini`, with `gemini-embedding-001` as the default embedding model and
  `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_API_KEY` support.
- Antigravity CLI (`agy`) support for MCP config (`serverUrl`) and lifecycle
  capture through its `PreInvocation`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, and `Stop`
  hook events.
- README support matrix for operating systems, agent integrations, LLM
  providers, and embedding providers.
- `ai-memory uninstall` — removes ai-memory's hooks, MCP registration, and
  CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md instruction block across all detected agents (dry-run by
  default; `--apply` to execute, with timestamped backups). `--purge-data`
  wipes wiki/db/raw via the reset guard. `--only hooks|mcp|instructions` to
  narrow. MCP matching is endpoint-based by default; pass `--mcp-url` when the
  server was installed with a custom endpoint and `--mcp-name` only to narrow
  removal to one matching entry. Docker/volume teardown is printed as a hint,
  not executed.

### Changed
- Same-body page upserts are now true no-ops, avoiding periodic watcher
  reconcile writes, FTS churn, and misleading recent-page timestamps.
- Graph-neighbor expansion for hybrid search now batches all seed pages into
  one SQL query instead of issuing incoming/outgoing lookups per seed.
- Embedding backfill stores embeddings in chunks instead of one writer
  command and SQLite transaction per page.
- Hook ingestion now bounds in-flight processing and returns HTTP 429 when
  saturated instead of spawning unbounded background tasks.
- Documented the vector backend policy and the measured criteria required
  before adding `sqlite-vec`.
- Clarified Gemini CLI support docs: MCP registration, lifecycle hooks,
  SessionStart handoff injection, and SessionEnd capture are now called out
  consistently across README and install guides.
- Added OpenClaw lifecycle support via a generated native plugin package and
  updated Cursor / Claude Desktop / OpenClaw support docs against current
  upstream MCP and hook documentation.
- Docker images now bundle both POSIX and PowerShell hook scripts.
- `ai-memory uninstall --purge-data` now previews the `wiki/`/`db/`/`raw/`
  wipe in dry-run (mirroring `reset`) and refuses **up front** if an
  `ai-memory` process is alive (all-or-nothing) instead of removing the
  wiring and then skipping the purge. The data wipe is now shared with
  `reset` via a single internal helper.
- `ai-memory uninstall` only deletes generated plugin/extension files after
  re-validating their ai-memory-generated content, and never treats a matching
  filename or MCP server name alone as proof of ownership.

### Fixed
- `serve` now warns and starts when stored embedding rows were created with a
  different `(provider, model, dim)` than the current config. Hybrid search
  ignores stale rows until `ai-memory embed --force` or scheduled backfill
  re-embeds them, avoiding the previous startup deadlock.
- Session capture now persists every documented agent kind (`cursor`,
  `gemini-cli`, `claude-desktop`, `openclaw`, `omp` / `pi`) instead of
  failing the `sessions.agent_kind` database CHECK for agents added after
  the initial schema.
- `memory_handoff_begin` and `memory_handoff_accept` now resolve the active
  project the same way the briefing/search tools do, so MCP handoffs land in
  the project currently reported by hooks instead of the server's baked
  default project.
- Natural-language `memory_query` text containing bare colons, such as
  `pick: handoff`, no longer trips FTS5 column syntax errors while explicit
  FTS operators like `quick OR slow` remain supported.
- Marker-file routing now reaches the generated OpenCode and OMP
  TypeScript hook integrations, not only the POSIX/PowerShell script
  hooks. POSIX helpers also preserve the outer hook `cwd` when nested
  tool payloads contain their own `cwd`, and encode `+` correctly in
  marker-derived query parameters.
- `backup --to` now streams the tarball to disk instead of buffering the full
  archive in CLI memory.
- Hyphenated FTS5 queries such as `ai-memory` are normalized safely instead of
  being parsed as column operators.
- Gemini 2.5 Flash requests disable default dynamic thinking so hidden thought
  tokens do not consume `maxOutputTokens` and truncate strict JSON responses.
- `install-mcp --client claude-code` now prints the direct-edit JSON path as
  `~/.claude.json`, matching the `--apply` path and `claude mcp add` behavior.
- Hook routing now evicts a stale project-cache entry and retries once when a
  live server sees a cached project deleted underneath it, such as after
  `purge-project`, so capture resumes without restarting the server.
- Session-start handoff hooks now include `cwd` even without a marker file, so
  default `project = basename(cwd)` projects receive pending handoffs without
  requiring `.ai-memory.toml`.
- `ai-memory uninstall` now removes only ai-memory commands from mixed nested
  hook entries, preserves third-party commands in the same matcher, and removes
  legacy Codex inline-table MCP entries.
- Generated POSIX hook commands now shell-quote script paths and env values
  with metacharacters, fixing custom hook directories containing spaces and
  preventing shell-active token/URL fragments.
- OpenClaw's generated plugin now forwards marker-file routing params just like
  the OpenCode and OMP generated integrations.
- The Linux/macOS Docker wrapper now lets thin-client commands such as
  `status` and `bootstrap` reach the local quick-start server bound on the
  host's `127.0.0.1:49374`.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- `ai-memory lint --no-llm` (and `memory_lint` `no_llm` arg) to run only the
  rule-based lint pass while leaving the LLM enabled for `memory_explore` /
  `memory_consolidate` ([#4]).

### Fixed
- `memory_lint` LLM contradiction pass silently never contributed: the
  `LintFinding` struct expected `severity`/`message` but the prompt asked for
  `summary`/`detail`. The prompt is now aligned to the canonical shape and the
  struct tolerates both (defaults `severity`, aliases `summary`→`message`,
  captures optional `detail`) ([#4]).
- Reasoning models (MiniMax M2.7, DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi) that emit
  `<think>…</think>` / `<analysis>…</analysis>` blocks before the JSON broke
  structured-output parsing (`key must be a string at line 1 column 2`). The
  openai-compat provider now strips reasoning blocks and surrounding markdown
  fences before extracting the JSON object, so lint / consolidate / bootstrap
  work with reasoning models ([#5]).
- openai-compat base URLs with non-`v1` version segments (e.g. Z.AI's `/v4`)
  or a full endpoint path no longer produce `…/v1/v1/…` 404s
  ([#6], thanks @lucasliet).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-24

### Changed
- HTTP transport now defaults to **stateless** mode (`json_response`, no
  `Mcp-Session-Id` required), so stateless MCP clients (OpenCode
  `type: "remote"`, `curl`) work without an `mcp-remote` stdio shim
  ([#3]). New `serve --transport http --http-stateful` flag restores the
  previous session+SSE behaviour for clients that need it.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- Wiki-structure migration framework: `wiki_migrations` SQL table (V06),
  `WikiMigration` trait, migration registry, and `run_pending` runner
  invoked at server startup before the watcher starts.
- MCP read tools (`memory_query`, `memory_recent`, `memory_status`,
  `memory_briefing`, `memory_explore`) accept an optional `project`
  argument to target a specific project on a shared server.

### Fixed
- OpenCode hook events (`tool.execute.*`, `session.*`) were rejected with
  "missing session_id" because OpenCode sends `sessionID` (capital `ID`)
  and the extractor only matched `sessionId`. All spellings are now
  accepted ([#1]).
- MCP read tools were locked to the server's static `--project` (default
  `scratch`), so on a shared HTTP server they returned empty memory even
  while hooks populated the correct per-cwd project. The hook router now
  publishes the active project to a shared pointer that the read tools
  use as their default; an explicit `project` argument overrides it ([#2]).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- Per-project UUID-namespaced wiki layout: pages live at
  `<wiki_root>/<workspace_id>/<project_id>/<page-path>`. Rename is now
  a single column update; purge is `remove_dir_all` on the project dir.
- CLI becomes a thin HTTP client: `bootstrap`, `status`, `search`,
  `reorg`, `lint`, `forget-sweep`, `embed`, `commit`, `backup`,
  `write-page` all delegate to the running server via `/admin/*` routes.
  The server is the sole writer of wiki + SQLite.
- `purge-project` command with cascade-delete indexes and per-project
  isolation guard (refuses to delete files claimed by sibling projects).
- `rename-project` command: column-only rename, no file moves.
- `memory_install_self_routing` MCP tool: installs the agent-routing
  snippet into CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / `.cursorrules` in one call.
- Read-only HTTP wiki browser (`/web`) with project tree, page view,
  and full-text search.
- Bearer token auth (`AI_MEMORY_AUTH_TOKEN` / `generate-auth-token`),
  Host-header allowlist, and 10 MB body cap for the HTTP server.
- `backup` / `restore` commands using `.tar.gz` archives with live-process
  guard (refuses to run if another `ai-memory` is active on the same data dir).
- Per-cwd project routing in hooks: observations route to the project
  matching the agent's working directory, not the server default.
- `opencode` / `openclaw` aliases for the OpenCode MCP client.
- Dockerised CLI wrapper (`bin/ai-memory`) with auto-restart for the
  local container and nudge for remote upgrades.
- `bootstrap` serialises parallel runs to prevent duplicate project creation
  and handles the case where the CWD has no git repo.
- Monthly log-md rotation to keep `log.md` from growing unbounded.
- `memory_consolidate` PreCompact checkpointing falls back to rule-based
  summarisation when no LLM is configured.
- `docs/lifecycle-ops.md`: safety matrix for state-touching commands
  (reset, restore, purge-project, rename-project).
- `docs/wiki-migrations.md`: when and how to write a wiki migration.

### Changed
- `bin/ai-memory` forwards `AI_MEMORY_SERVER_URL` and no longer creates
  `-w` mount-conflict directories.
- `bootstrap` resolves the repo root via `libgit2`, removing the
  `git` binary dependency.
- Admin routes consolidated: dry-run support, correct status codes,
  deduplicated handlers.
- Host-header allowlist sourced from `Config.allowed_hosts`; logged at
  startup so operators can verify the effective list.

### Fixed
- `AI_MEMORY_HOST_CWD` handling and dry-run no-project side effects.
- Web page view: strip leading H1 from body to prevent title duplication.
- `install-mcp` Codex config key was `bearer_token`, not
  `http_headers` / `headers`.
- Consolidator used server startup default project instead of the
  session's actual project.
