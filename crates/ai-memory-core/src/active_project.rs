//! A process-shared pointer to the project the user is currently active in.
//!
//! ## Why this exists (issue #2)
//!
//! The MCP protocol carries no working-directory context: a `memory_query`
//! call arrives with its arguments and nothing else, so a tool handler has
//! no way to know which project the agent is sitting in. The lifecycle hooks
//! *do* know — every `/hook` event carries the agent's `cwd`, and the hook
//! router resolves it to the correct per-cwd `(workspace_id, project_id)`.
//!
//! In HTTP mode the `/hook` ingress and the `/mcp` endpoint live in the same
//! process, so the hook router can publish "the project the user is currently
//! active in" to this shared pointer, and the MCP tools can read it as their
//! default instead of falling back to the server's static `--project` (which
//! defaults to `scratch` and made the read tools return empty memory even
//! when the hooks were correctly populating a real project).
//!
//! The pointer reflects the most recently resolved cwd-based project. For the
//! common single-user, one-project-at-a-time workflow this is exactly right.
//! For the rarer case of one shared server fielding several projects
//! concurrently, the MCP tools also accept an explicit `project` argument that
//! takes precedence over this pointer.
//!
//! The lock is held only for the microseconds it takes to copy a small tuple;
//! callers never `.await` while holding it, so a plain `std::sync::RwLock` is
//! the right primitive (no async lock needed).
