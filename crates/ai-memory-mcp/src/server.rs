pub const MEMORY_INSTRUCTIONS: &str = "\
Long-term memory for the current project.\n\
\n\
**Default to the current project — always.** Every tool here \
auto-scopes to the project resolved from your session's working \
directory. **Do NOT pass `project` or `cwd` arguments unless the user \
explicitly references a *different* project by name** (e.g. 'what did \
we decide in the other-app project?'). Phrases like 'this project', \
'here', 'we', 'our work', 'where did we leave off' all mean the \
*current* project — call the tool with no scoping args. If the user \
asks about a handoff and the SessionStart auto-fetched block is already \
in your context, answer from it; do NOT re-call the tool to look for it \
in another project.\n\
\n\
Lifecycle hooks already capture every prompt + tool call automatically \
— you do NOT need to write routine notes by hand. When the user \
explicitly asks to remember a permanent annotation/fact/rule, write a \
durable wiki page; do not use a handoff for that. Use these tools when \
the conversation calls for them:\n\
\n\
- `memory_query` — when the user references prior work you don't \
  recognise, or asks 'have we done / discussed X', or you're about \
  to propose architecture (always check first).\n\
- `memory_recent` — at session start, or when the user asks 'what's \
  been going on lately'. Returns the N most-recent pages.\n\
- `memory_status` — when the user asks 'is ai-memory healthy' or \
  'how big is the knowledge base'. Returns lifetime counts.\n\
- `memory_briefing` — when the user wants a STRUCTURED snapshot \
  (counts + 7d/30d activity + rules + recent pages, JSON, no LLM \
  call). Use over memory_status when more detail is wanted.\n\
- `memory_explore` — when the user wants a PROSE digest. \
  Calibrates verbosity to time since last activity: 'fresh' → one \
  line, 'stale' (>30d) → full catchup. Accepts an optional `focus` \
  arg. Use over memory_briefing when the user asks open-ended \
  questions like 'catch me up' or 'what's important right now'.\n\
- `memory_handoff_accept` — when the user asks 'where did we leave \
  off'. The SessionStart hook auto-fetches + consumes the handoff \
  before you see your first prompt; if a block starting with \
  '📥 ai-memory: pending handoff' is anywhere in your context, \
  THAT is the handoff — answer from it directly, don't re-call \
  this tool (it'll return null because handoffs are single-use).\n\
- `memory_handoff_begin` — when the user is wrapping up and you \
  want to ensure the next agent has context (the SessionEnd hook \
  also auto-captures this). Keep the summary terse (2-3 sentences); \
  put detail in open_questions + next_steps bullets.\n\
- `memory_consolidate` — when the user asks to compile session \
  observations into wiki pages. Also runs on PreCompact, and at \
  session end only when AI_MEMORY_CONSOLIDATE_ON_SESSION_END is set.\n\
- `memory_write_page` — when the user explicitly asks to remember, \
  save, or annotate durable project knowledge. This writes a wiki page; \
  do NOT use `memory_handoff_begin` for permanent annotations.\n\
- `memory_read_page` — when the user asks to read, open, or show the \
  full content of a specific page. Accepts a `query` (searches FTS5 and \
  returns the top hit's full body) or a `path` (direct lookup). Use \
  this instead of memory_query when the user wants the complete text, \
  not just snippets.\n\
- `memory_delete_page` — when the user explicitly asks to delete or \
  remove a specific page (by exact path). Idempotent; fires the \
  admission chain so mirrors/backups stay consistent.\n\
- `memory_lint` — when the user asks to audit the wiki for stale \
  pages, contradictions, or rule suggestions.\n\
- `memory_forget_sweep` — when the user wants to prune old / cold \
  pages (idempotent, supports dry-run).\n\
- `memory_install_self_routing` — when the user asks to 'install \
  ai-memory routing into this project' or 'add ai-memory to \
  CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md'. Returns the canonical routing snippet + \
  filename hints; you then use your own Write/Edit tool to land it \
  in the right rules file (Claude Code → CLAUDE.md, Codex / \
  OpenCode / Cursor / Gemini → AGENTS.md).\n\
\n\
The routing snippet this very text comes from can also be installed \
into the project's CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md so the guidance survives \
across sessions. From the agent: ask 'install ai-memory routing'. \
From the terminal: `ai-memory install-instructions`.";
