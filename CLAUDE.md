# CLAUDE.md — ai-memory project directives

> Read this every session before touching code. The long-form research and
> design specs live under [`docs/`](docs/); this file is the operating rules.

## What this project is

A self-contained Rust binary providing long-term memory for AI coding agents
(Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, OpenCode) over the Model Context Protocol.
Storage = markdown-in-git wiki (source of truth) + SQLite (derived index).
Capture = automatic via agent lifecycle hooks, never manual `write_note`.
Consolidation = Karpathy "LLM Wiki" pattern with versioned supersession.

Read [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) first for the
operational summary. Read [`docs/design-decisions.md`](docs/design-decisions.md)
for the full v1 spec. Read [`docs/research-karpathy-llm-wiki.md`](docs/research-karpathy-llm-wiki.md)
for what "Karpathy-faithful" means in practice.

## Stack (do not deviate without updating `docs/design-decisions.md` §4)

- **Runtime:** Rust 1.95 (pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`), edition 2024,
  resolver 3, async via `tokio`.
- **MCP:** `rmcp` (official `modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk`).
- **Store:** `rusqlite` + `refinery` migrations, FTS5 in v1, `sqlite-vec` in
  v0.2. **One file**, one writer actor, one read pool.
- **Wiki:** markdown on disk, `notify-debouncer-full` watcher with heartbeat
  + reconciliation, `git2` for versioning.
- **HTTP:** `axum` for hook ingress + MCP HTTP/SSE.
- **LLM:** typed clients per provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenAI-compat) via
  `reqwest`. **Never** a generic gateway like LiteLLM (cognee #2840 lesson).
- **Config:** `figment`, one read at startup, passed by `&Arc<Config>`.
- **Logging:** `tracing` with module filters; never let the appender's own
  module log at INFO+ (agentmemory #519 lesson).

## Workflow rules

1. **Milestone by milestone.** Do not start M(n+1) until every "Done when"
   bullet in M(n) passes. See [`docs/design-decisions.md`](docs/design-decisions.md)
   for the milestone list. No mixing.
2. **No dead code, no half-built features.** If a feature is not finished,
   it does not land. If you must stub something, document it as `M(n) TODO`
   in the relevant module's doc-comment with the milestone number.
3. **Tests before claiming done.** Every milestone requires:
   - `cargo fmt --all -- --check` (no diffs)
   - `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` (no warnings)
   - `cargo test --workspace` (all green)
   - Manual exercise of the new feature against a real agent CLI when applicable.
4. **Document the why in code, not the what.** No comments restating the line
   above; only comments explaining a constraint, an incident, or a non-obvious
   invariant.
5. **Add a unit test before the implementation, not after.** Especially for
   parsers, ID derivation, and any retention/decay math.
6. **Don't refactor outside the milestone.** Touch only what the current
   milestone requires; resist scope creep.

## Cross-cutting invariants (carved in, never violated)

These come straight from issue-tracker research on agentmemory, basic-memory
and cognee — every one of them is in `docs/design-decisions.md` §14 with
issue citations. **Treat any code review that violates one of these as a
blocking issue:**

1. One config-read path. No `std::env::var` outside `Config::load()`.
2. Single-writer SQLite actor. All writes through one `mpsc` channel.
3. Indexes commit in the same transaction as the data. No
   background-task-indexing-after-return.
4. Typed `(WorkspaceId, ProjectId, PagePath)` identity in every layer.
5. Hooks are fire-and-forget. Sub-second timeouts. Return 202 immediately.
6. Privacy strip is a typed boundary (`RawHookPayload → Sanitized<Observation>`).
7. JSON-schema structured outputs only. No XML, no `instructor`-style wrapping.
8. `{provider, model, dim}` stored next to every embedding. Refuse on mismatch.
9. Live-process check (`sysinfo`) before any destructive op.
10. Atomic file writes (tmp + rename + fsync). Watcher ignores own writes.
11. Default data dir is an absolute canonical platform path.
    Logged loudly on startup.
12. No global singletons / `lazy_static` configs.
13. Zero-LLM default path. LLM features opt-in via env.
14. Tracing subscribers explicitly filter their own module.
15. **Every command + storage operation is namespaced by the current
    sub-dir as the project id.** The router derives the project from
    `basename(cwd)`; bootstrap / lint / embed / forget-sweep /
    purge-project / rename-project / consolidate ALL resolve through
    the same helper. There is no generic `scratch` fallback in the
    happy path — `scratch` exists only as a defensive default for
    hook events that arrive without a `cwd` (e.g. early startup or
    misconfigured agents). New commands/handlers that bake in a
    `workspace_id`/`project_id` at construction time MUST look up
    the session's actual project (via
    `ReaderPool::session_project_ids` or equivalent) before writing.
16. **The CLI is always a thin HTTP client to the running MCP /
    admin server.** The server is the ground truth and the sole
    writer of wiki + SQLite. CLI commands NEVER call `Store::open`,
    `Wiki::new`, `build_provider`, or `build_embedder`. State
    mutations go through `/admin/*` HTTP routes; reads go through
    MCP tools or `/admin/*` GETs. The two exceptions are
    `init` / `serve` / `generate-auth-token` / `install-*` /
    `setup-agent` — local-only setup commands that don't touch
    server state. Use the shared `crate::http_client::{ServerEndpoint,
    get_json, post_json}` plumbing for every new client subcommand.

## Mistakes documented in the research — do NOT repeat

- [`docs/issues-agentmemory.md`](docs/issues-agentmemory.md): install/ops
  landmines (iii-engine sidecar, distroless volumes, cwd-relative paths).
- [`docs/issues-basic-memory.md`](docs/issues-basic-memory.md): file watcher
  pain, manual-capture friction, multi-workspace retrofit.
- [`docs/issues-cognee.md`](docs/issues-cognee.md): LiteLLM/instructor wire
  drift, multi-store sync bugs, dependency landmines.

When in doubt about a design decision, search those files for the keyword.

## What this project is NOT (v1 non-goals)

See [`docs/design-decisions.md`](docs/design-decisions.md) §13 for the full
list. Highlights: no multi-tenant auth, no web UI, no Postgres backend in v1,
no alternative vector backends, no remote sync (use `git remote` on the wiki
dir), no multimodal.

<!-- ai-memory:start -->
## Long-term memory (ai-memory)

This project uses [ai-memory](https://github.com/akitaonrails/ai-memory)
for cross-session continuity. **Lifecycle hooks already capture every
prompt + tool call automatically.** You never need to manually write
notes; the SessionStart hook auto-fetches pending handoffs and the
SessionEnd hook auto-consolidates. Just *use* the read tools.

### When to reach for each tool

The user can express any of the intents below in plain English —
match the intent to the tool. They do not need to name the tool.

| User says / situation | Tool |
|---|---|
| "have we discussed X?" / "search memory for Y" / before proposing architecture | `memory_query` |
| "what's been going on" / "show recent activity" (light) | `memory_recent` |
| "is ai-memory healthy?" / "how big is the wiki?" | `memory_status` |
| "give me the stats" / structured snapshot for the agent to consume | `memory_briefing` |
| "catch me up" / "I've been away" / "what's important right now?" / open-ended exploration | `memory_explore` |
| "where did we leave off?" — and you see a `📥 ai-memory: pending handoff` block in your context | already done — answer from that block; do NOT re-call `memory_handoff_accept` |
| "where did we leave off?" — and no such block is visible | `memory_handoff_accept` (rare; the SessionStart hook usually got there first) |
| "save context for the next session" / wrapping up | `memory_handoff_begin` (terse summary; put detail in `open_questions` + `next_steps` bullets) |
| "consolidate this session" / "compile what we learned" (usually automatic) | `memory_consolidate` |
| "audit the wiki" / "find contradictions" / "what rules should we add?" | `memory_lint` |
| "prune old pages" / "memory cleanup" | `memory_forget_sweep` |

`memory_explore` is the right default for the "I want to know what's
going on" use case — it returns a prose digest whose verbosity
scales automatically to how long it's been since the last activity
(< 1 h → one line; > 30 days → full catchup).

### When you write a project rule, write it here

If you're about to write a durable project rule ("always X", "never
Y", "all PRs must …"), this file (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md) is where
the rule belongs. ai-memory's lint pass surfaces the same hint
automatically when a `kind: rule` page lands in `_rules/`.

### Refreshing this snippet

This block is maintained by ai-memory. To re-sync it with the
latest binary's recommended copy (e.g. when new tools ship), run:

```
ai-memory install-instructions
```

It's idempotent: re-runs replace the block bracketed by
`<!-- ai-memory:start -->` / `<!-- ai-memory:end -->` markers
without disturbing the rest of the file.
<!-- ai-memory:end -->
` markers
without disturbing the rest of the file.
<!-- ai-memory:end -->
