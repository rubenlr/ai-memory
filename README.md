## Support Matrix

| Area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | Supported | Primary Docker/server target and CI platform. Published Docker images support `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. Native Arch/AUR packages include system and user systemd units. |
| macOS | Supported | Workspace tests run in CI; native source builds are supported. Docker images run natively on Apple Silicon via the `linux/arm64` manifest. |
| Windows via WSL2 | Supported | Use the Linux install path inside WSL2 when the agent runs there. |
| Native Windows | Experimental | PowerShell wrapper is available. Claude Code uses Git Bash `.sh` hooks on native Windows; other script-hook agents use the current PowerShell defaults pending harness feedback. See [`docs/windows.md`](docs/windows.md). |
| Claude Code | Supported | MCP config + lifecycle hooks. |
| Codex | Supported | MCP config + lifecycle hooks. |
| OpenCode | Supported | Remote MCP config + generated TypeScript plugin. |
| Cursor | Supported | MCP config + lifecycle hooks. |
| Gemini CLI | Supported | MCP config + lifecycle hooks. |
| Oh My Pi / OMP | Supported | `pi` / `omp` aliases for MCP config + TypeScript extension. |
| Claude Desktop | MCP-only | Uses `mcp-remote`; no lifecycle hooks. |
| OpenClaw | Supported | MCP config + native plugin lifecycle hooks. |
| Antigravity CLI | Supported | MCP config (`serverUrl`) + lifecycle hooks (`agy` alias). |

| Embedding providers | Supported | OpenAI, Voyage, and Google Gemini. |

## What it is

LLM coding agents lose all context when a session ends. ai-memory
gives them a shared, persistent wiki: every prompt, tool call, and
decision is captured automatically; when a session ends, the relevant
pages get rewritten as a coherent narrative; when the next agent
starts (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, …) it sees a handoff with
"where you left off" already prepended.

The wiki is plain markdown in a git repo - `grep`-able, openable in
Obsidian, backed up with `rsync`. No vector database to babysit, no
`write_note` ceremony, no manual context-loading. The full design is
in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md); the influences and
priors are at the [bottom](#influences-and-prior-art).

## Key features

- **Zero-friction capture.** Lifecycle hooks fire-and-forget every
  prompt + tool call + session boundary. You never type `write_note`.
- **Cross-agent handoffs.** Quit Claude Code mid-task, start Codex
  in the same directory hours later - the next agent sees a
  "where you left off" block before its first prompt.
- **Per-project isolation by construction.** Each project lives at
  `<wiki_root>/<workspace_id>/<project_id>/…` keyed by stable UUIDs.
  Workspace defaults to `"default"`. Project is derived from `$cwd`:
  CLI subcommands (`bootstrap`, `write-page`, `lint`, …) walk to the
  main git repo root so all worktrees of the same repo share one
  project identity; the hook router defaults to `basename($cwd)` and
  can opt into the repo-root rule. Drop a
  [`.ai-memory.toml` marker file](docs/marker-file.md) in any
  ancestor directory to override either field explicitly — perfect for
  multi-client consultancies, work/personal split, mono-repos, or
  linked git worktrees.
  Same page path can exist in two projects without collision; a
  rename is one column update; a purge is one `rm -rf`.
- **Karpathy-style LLM wiki.** Pages are compiled from observations
  at session-end (or PreCompact), not retrieved over raw logs.
  Supersession chain + git-versioned markdown means you can
  time-travel with `git log`.
- **Built-in `/web` browser.** Read-only HTML UI for the wiki -
  project list, folder tree, FTS5 search, markdown rendering, dark
  mode. Mounted on the same axum server as MCP.
- **Multi-agent + multi-machine ready.** Supported clients: Claude
  Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, Claude Desktop (via `mcp-remote`),
  Gemini CLI, Antigravity CLI, OpenClaw, and Oh My Pi / OMP
  (`pi` / `omp` aliases).
  Server runs local (loopback) OR on a homelab box (LAN/VPN/cloud)
  with bearer-token auth. Shared servers can opt into
  [`[auto_scope]` modes](docs/auto-scope.md) for per-user or
  session-aware current-project routing.
- **Thin-client CLI.** `ai-memory status`, `bootstrap`, `purge-project`,
  `rename-project`, `move-project`, `lint`, `embed`, `forget-sweep`, `backup` are
  all HTTP clients of the running server - never touch SQLite or
  wiki files directly. `status` also reports passive LLM/embedding
  provider health from the last real provider call. Server is the
  single source of truth.
- **LLM is opt-in.** Zero-LLM mode still gives you FTS5 search +
  rule-based summarisation. Add a provider when you want consolidated
  pages and lint contradictions.

## Use cases

- **"Quit at 4 PM, pick up at 9 AM in a different agent."** The
  classic. SessionStart hook in the next agent (any of the
  supported CLIs) prepends a typed handoff with the open questions,
  next steps, and a session summary.
- **"What did we decide about X six weeks ago?"** Type
  `memory_query X` from the agent (or `ai-memory search X` from a
  terminal) - FTS5 over the wiki. Pages are LLM-consolidated, so
  the hit is a coherent decision page, not a raw chat log.
- **"Remember this permanently."** When something is worth keeping
  beyond auto-captured session logs - a decision, a convention, a
  gotcha - tell the agent "save a permanent note that we standardised
  on Postgres for X" or "annotate this as a project rule" and it calls
  `memory_write_page` to write a durable, git-versioned wiki page. From
  a terminal it's `ai-memory write-page --path decisions/0007-db.md
  --body $'# Standardised on Postgres\n\n...' --pinned`. `--pinned`
  exempts it from the decay sweep; the H1 on the first line of
  `--body` becomes the page title (omit `--title` — it's still
  accepted, but LLM callers trip over JSON-escaping their way through
  it, see issue #67). Unlike a handoff (single-use) or an
  auto-synthesised session page (rewritten on consolidation), a
  write-page note is yours: it shows up in `memory_query`, renders in
  `/web`, and stays until you change it.
- **"This new project has months of history before ai-memory."**
  `cd /path/to/my-project && ai-memory bootstrap` collects
  `git log`, README, `docs/`, module headers, project rules and
  one-shot-summarises them into seed wiki pages. Future sessions
  build on top.
- **"Run one ai-memory for the whole household."** Stand the server
  up on a homelab box at `0.0.0.0:49374` with a bearer token; every
  laptop/desktop talks to it. Per-cwd routing keeps each project's
  pages cleanly separated; the `/web` UI is reachable from a
  browser anywhere on the LAN.
- **"Audit what landed before sharing with a teammate."** Browse
  the wiki at `http://<server>:49374/web` - HTTP Basic dialog if
  auth is on, paste the token as password. Per-project tree view,
  rendered markdown, supersession chain visible per page.
- **"Drop an experiment, keep the rest."**
  `ai-memory purge-project --project experimental --confirm`.
  Atomic: that project's DB rows cascade away, its wiki subdir gets
  `rm -rf`'d, every sibling project is untouched by construction.

## Quick start

### Arch Linux (AUR)

For native Arch installs, use the AUR packages. They install
`/usr/bin/ai-memory`, packaged hook sources, and both system-level and
user-level systemd units.

```bash
yay -S ai-memory-bin    # prebuilt Linux x86_64/aarch64 binary
yay -S ai-memory        # builds from source
```

Single-user workstation:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/ai-memory ~/.local/share/ai-memory
ai-memory --data-dir ~/.local/share/ai-memory \
  --config ~/.config/ai-memory/config.toml init
systemctl --user enable --now ai-memory.service
ai-memory install-mcp --client claude-code --apply
ai-memory install-hooks --agent claude-code --apply
```

System service installs use `/var/lib/ai-memory` and `/etc/ai-memory/` via the
packaged unit. Full user-service, system-service, auth, and provider setup is in
[`docs/install.md#arch-linux-native-packages-aur`](docs/install.md#arch-linux-native-packages-aur).

### Docker

You need: Docker + an agent CLI (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, OMP, Cursor,
Antigravity CLI, or anything else that speaks MCP).

The published Docker image includes `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` variants,
so Apple Silicon Macs and ARM64 Linux hosts can pull `akitaonrails/ai-memory`
without `--platform linux/amd64` emulation.

The default quick-start has **no authentication** - the server binds
to loopback only, so on a single-user laptop nothing else can reach
it. Adding a bearer token is a one-line change once you're ready to
expose the server on the LAN; see [Security](#security) below.

```bash
# 1. Install the ai-memory CLI wrapper (a ~3 KB shell script that
#    runs the binary inside docker with your $HOME mounted). This is
#    the only thing that needs to live on the host filesystem.
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akitaonrails/ai-memory/main/bin/ai-memory \
    -o ~/.local/bin/ai-memory
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/ai-memory
# Most distros put ~/.local/bin on PATH automatically. If `which
# ai-memory` comes up empty, add this to ~/.bashrc / ~/.zshrc:
#     export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# 2. Start the server. `--restart unless-stopped` makes it come back
#    on docker daemon restart and on machine boot (provided your
#    docker service is enabled at boot — `sudo systemctl enable
#    docker` on most distros). Loopback-only bind (`127.0.0.1:49374`)
#    so nothing outside this machine can reach it. Omit the LLM /
#    EMBEDDING lines for zero-LLM mode — FTS5 search still works
#    without any keys.
docker run -d --name ai-memory \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    -p 127.0.0.1:49374:49374 \
    -v ai-memory-data:/data \
    -e AI_MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic \
    -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... \
    -e AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai \
    -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... \
    akitaonrails/ai-memory:latest

# 3. Wire your agent CLI in two commands. The wrapper takes care of
#    mounts + auto-detecting ~/.claude/settings.json. Re-run with
#    `--agent codex`, `--agent opencode`, `--agent gemini-cli`,
#    `--agent omp`/`pi`, `--client cursor`, `--client gemini-cli`, etc.
#    for additional agents; full list in docs/install.md.
ai-memory install-mcp   --client claude-code --apply
ai-memory install-hooks --agent  claude-code --apply
```

On Linux/macOS, that's it. Start a Claude Code session as usual - every
prompt and tool call now lands in ai-memory, and the next session you
open in this project will see a handoff with where you left off.

The `install-mcp` / `install-hooks` commands use
`AI_MEMORY_SERVER_URL` / `AI_MEMORY_AUTH_TOKEN` when set; otherwise
they default to `http://127.0.0.1:49374` (matching the server above)
and no bearer token. If hooks are installed after an ai-memory MCP
entry already exists, `install-hooks` reuses that endpoint so a remote
MCP setup cannot silently regenerate loopback-only hooks. Both commands
are idempotent - re-runs replace ai-memory's entry, preserve every
other server / hook you have configured, and write a timestamped
`.bak-<ts>` next to the file before each modifying write. The hook
scripts are staged into `~/.local/share/ai-memory/hooks/<agent>/`
automatically; re-running overwrites them so future image updates ship
updated hooks. Drop `--apply` to print the snippet instead of mutating.

The Docker wrapper also bridges thin-client commands such as
`ai-memory status` and `ai-memory bootstrap` back to the host's
loopback server. With the local Docker quick start above, no
`AI_MEMORY_SERVER_URL` override is needed.

To remove ai-memory later, run `ai-memory uninstall --apply` from the
same host environment. It removes ai-memory-owned config entries and
generated plugin files only after matching their ai-memory signatures;
use `--mcp-url` if you installed MCP with a custom endpoint, and
`--mcp-name` only when you need to narrow removal to one matching entry.

### Install Notes

- **Windows:** use the Linux path inside WSL2, or the native Windows wrapper
  from PowerShell/cmd. Native Claude Code uses Git Bash `.sh` hooks; other
  script-hook agents use PowerShell defaults. Do not mix path worlds. See
  [`docs/windows.md`](docs/windows.md).
- **Docker compose:** `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d`
  is supported; agent setup is the same as step 3 above.
- **Remote server:** set `AI_MEMORY_SERVER_URL=http://<server-ip>:49374`
  and `AI_MEMORY_AUTH_TOKEN=<token>` on the client before installing
  MCP/hooks. Explicit `--server-url` flags still work, but are no longer
  required when the env vars are set. Any non-loopback server should use
  bearer auth.
- **Upgrades:** run `ai-memory upgrade` to refresh the wrapper, image,
  and staged hook scripts. Redeploy remote servers separately.

For Codex, OpenCode, OMP, Cursor, Claude Desktop, Gemini CLI, Antigravity CLI,
OpenClaw, curl-based hook installs, source builds, CLI env vars, and the full
subcommand reference, see [`docs/install.md`](docs/install.md).

## Security

Loopback-only (`127.0.0.1:49374`) with no auth is the default because
it is safe for a single-user laptop: no process outside the machine can
reach the server.

Enable bearer auth when the server is exposed beyond loopback, when
untrusted local processes share the machine, or when the data dir holds
sensitive project history:

```bash
TOKEN=$(ai-memory generate-auth-token)

docker run -d --name ai-memory \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    -p 0.0.0.0:49374:49374 \
    -v ai-memory-data:/data \
    -e AI_MEMORY_AUTH_TOKEN="$TOKEN" \
    -e AI_MEMORY_ALLOWED_HOSTS="<server-ip>,localhost,127.0.0.1" \
    akitaonrails/ai-memory:latest

ai-memory install-mcp   --client claude-code --apply \
    --server-url "http://<server-ip>:49374/mcp" --auth-token "$TOKEN"
ai-memory install-hooks --agent  claude-code --apply \
    --server-url "http://<server-ip>:49374" --auth-token "$TOKEN"
```

Bearer auth protects `/mcp`, `/hook`, `/handoff`, `/admin/*`, and
`/web/*`. Browser access to `/web` uses HTTP Basic auth with the token
as the password. Non-loopback binds should also set
`AI_MEMORY_ALLOWED_HOSTS` to guard against DNS rebinding.

**Want HTTPS?** ai-memory deliberately does not terminate TLS itself —
the right answer is a battle-tested reverse proxy in front of it.
[`docs/https-via-proxy.md`](docs/https-via-proxy.md) is the deployment
guide, with copy-paste docker compose templates in
[`docker/compose.tls.caddy.yml`](docker/compose.tls.caddy.yml) (Caddy
with Let's Encrypt or internal CA) and
[`docker/compose.tls.cloudflared.yml`](docker/compose.tls.cloudflared.yml)
(Cloudflare Tunnel — no open ports). Both are recommended once you
turn on multi-user or bind beyond loopback. The Quick Start happy
path of single-user on loopback doesn't need TLS — that case is
called out explicitly in the guide so you don't add ceremony where
it doesn't earn its keep.

**Multi-user attribution (v0.8, optional).** When more than one human
shares a server, ai-memory can attribute each write to a named user.
The bearer token continues to authenticate at the wire level; users
created via `ai-memory user add` get their own tokens that resolve to
their identity in audit logs (and, in subsequent milestones, page
frontmatter + the web UI). Data stays single-tenant — there is no
per-page RBAC — but once `[auth].token_pepper` enables multi-user
mode, operational `/admin/*` endpoints such as backup, purge, move,
embed, and commit require the root token. Existing single-user installs
are not affected unless you opt in by setting `[auth].token_pepper`
(auto-generated for new installs by `ai-memory init`). See
[`docs/users.md`](docs/users.md) for the full walkthrough and the
four-rung auth ladder.

See [`docs/deploy.md`](docs/deploy.md) for the full homelab pattern
with bearer auth, host allowlisting, and TLS/reverse-proxy options.

## Using Memory

Day to day, you mostly do not think about ai-memory. Lifecycle hooks
capture prompts, tool calls, compaction checkpoints, and session
boundaries. SessionStart hooks fetch pending handoffs before your first
prompt in the next agent.

Useful entry points:

- Ask "where did we leave off?" to continue from the pending handoff.
- Ask "have we discussed X?" or "search memory for Y" to query the wiki.
- Ask "catch me up" for a prose digest of recent project activity.
- Run `ai-memory bootstrap` once when adopting ai-memory in an existing
  project with months of history.
- Start the server with `--enable-web` and visit `/web` for a read-only
  browser view of the markdown wiki. `--enable-web` also mounts a
  read-only JSON frontend API at `/api/v1` (workspaces, projects, pages,
  recent, briefing, search) so custom web UIs can read the memory without
  opening SQLite or wiki files directly:

  ```text
  GET  /api/v1/workspaces
  GET  /api/v1/projects?workspace=...
  GET  /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace}/projects/{project}/pages
  GET  /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace}/projects/{project}/pages/{path}
  GET  /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace}/projects/{project}/recent?limit=...
  GET  /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace}/projects/{project}/briefing?limit=...
  GET  /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace}/overview?limit=...
  GET  /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace}/projects/{project}/overview?limit=...
  GET  /api/v1/search?q=...&workspace=...&project=...&limit=...
  POST /api/v1/search   { "q": "...", "scopes": [{ "workspace": "...", "project": "..." }] }
  ```

  `overview` bundles the open handoff + briefing + memory-health for a workspace
  or project in one call (the data a project overview screen needs).

  **Full integration guide:** see [`docs/frontend-api.md`](docs/frontend-api.md)
  for auth setup, response schemas, error model, limits/pagination,
  custom-UI hosting, a worked `fetch`/`curl` example, and the canonical
  source-of-truth files. Read that first if you're building a frontend.

  To serve your own static frontend instead of the built-in UI, point
  `--web-ui-dir` at the frontend's build output (same-origin with
  `/api/v1`, `/mcp`, `/admin/*`, so the existing auth applies):

  ```bash
  ai-memory serve --transport http --bind 127.0.0.1:49374 \
    --enable-web --web-ui-dir ../ai-memory-ui/dist
  ```

  A reference implementation — a SolidJS knowledge browser with
  screenshots and e2e tests — lives at
  [djalmajr/ai-memory-ui](https://github.com/djalmajr/ai-memory-ui).

  When a reverse proxy hosts ai-memory under a URL subpath, set
  `--base-path` (or `AI_MEMORY_BASE_PATH`) so every HTTP surface moves
  together. Example: `--base-path /wiki` serves MCP at `/wiki/mcp`, hooks at
  `/wiki/hook`, the API at `/wiki/api/v1`, and the default browser at
  `/wiki/web`. Set `--web-slug /` if you want the browser or custom SPA at
  `/wiki` itself.

Install the routing snippet once so agents proactively call the right
MCP tool for those prompts:

```bash
ai-memory install-instructions
```

See [`docs/usage.md`](docs/usage.md) for handoff examples, proactive
query routing, bootstrap details, web UI screenshots, and the raw-wiki
inspection commands. CLI URL/auth configuration lives in
[`docs/install.md`](docs/install.md#configuring-the-cli-url-and-auth).

## LLM Providers

ai-memory runs without an LLM: hooks still capture sessions, search uses
FTS5, and summaries fall back to rule-based output. Add an LLM provider
when you want LLM consolidation (on PreCompact, on demand via
`memory_consolidate`, or opt-in at session end with
`AI_MEMORY_CONSOLIDATE_ON_SESSION_END`), richer linting, and bootstrap.
Session end always writes a rule-based summary page + handoff either way.

Recommended defaults:

| Provider | Default | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `anthropic` | `claude-haiku-4-5` | Best default for consolidation quality and rule classification. |
| `anthropic-oauth` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Use a Claude Pro/Max subscription via `claude setup-token`, no API key. |
| `openai` | `gpt-5.4-mini` | Cheaper and faster hosted option. |
| `openai-oauth` | `gpt-5.5` | ChatGPT Pro/Plus/Codex backend via `ai-memory auth login openai-oauth`; no Platform API key. |
| `copilot` | `gpt-5.5` | GitHub Copilot Chat backend via `ai-memory auth login copilot` or `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`; requires a Copilot subscription. |
| `gemini` | `gemini-2.5-flash` | Google-hosted option with a generous free tier. |
| `openai-compat` | no default | OpenRouter, Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, and other compatible endpoints. |

`openai-oauth` stores a refresh token in `<data_dir>/auth.json` and talks to
the ChatGPT/Codex Responses backend, not `api.openai.com`. For Docker quick
starts, run `ai-memory auth login openai-oauth` with the wrapper so the token
lands in the same `ai-memory-data` volume as the server.

`anthropic-oauth` hits the same `/v1/messages` endpoint as `anthropic` but
authenticates with an OAuth bearer token instead of an API key. Run
`claude setup-token` once, then set `AI_MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic-oauth` and
`ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN=<token>` (or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, which `claude
setup-token` writes automatically). No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is needed.
**⚠️ Unofficial and against Anthropic's usage policies — use at your own risk;
it may get your account rate-limited or banned. See
[the warning in `docs/install.md`](docs/install.md#anthropic-via-claude-subscription-oauth).**

`copilot` stores a GitHub user token in the same auth file, exchanges it for a
short-lived Copilot API token via GitHub's `/copilot_internal/v2/token`, and
uses the Copilot Chat endpoint with `vscode-chat` integration headers. You can
also set `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, or `GITHUB_TOKEN` on the server.

> [!TIP]
> **For the OAuth/subscription backends (`anthropic-oauth`, `openai-oauth`,
> `copilot`), pick a small, fast model** via `AI_MEMORY_LLM_MODEL` — e.g.
> `claude-haiku-4-5` or `gpt-5-mini`. ai-memory's LLM work (consolidation,
> lint, explore) is summarisation, not hard reasoning, so a Haiku/mini-class
> model is plenty and is much easier on subscription rate limits. Save the
> high-effort thinking models for your coding agent.

> [!TIP]
> **On a local engine (Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, llama.cpp) with
> `openai-compat`, if consolidation fails on large sessions** with
> `did not contain a JSON object` or `serde: unknown variant`, set
> `AI_MEMORY_LLM_COMPAT_STRICT=true`. It sends `response_format=json_schema`
> (strict) so capable engines constrain output to the schema. If the strict
> raw call fails, ai-memory falls back to the default tolerant parser. Off by
> default.

Embeddings are optional and separate from the LLM provider. Set
`AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai`, `voyage`, `google`, or `gemini` when
you want vector reranking in addition to FTS5 + graph-neighbor retrieval.

See [`docs/install.md#llm-provider-tiers`](docs/install.md#llm-provider-tiers)
for env vars and Ollama/OpenRouter examples, and
[`docs/llm-provider-comparison.md`](docs/llm-provider-comparison.md)
for the empirical model comparison.

## Architecture

One Rust binary runs an MCP/HTTP server and owns one data directory:

```text
<data_dir>/
├── wiki/    # markdown source of truth, git-versioned
├── raw/     # immutable session log archive
├── db/      # SQLite indexes, including FTS5 and embeddings
├── models/  # reserved for local embedding models
└── logs/    # rolling tracing output
```

Hooks POST observations to the server. The server serializes writes
through one SQLite writer, compiles session observations into markdown
pages, and serves retrieval through FTS5, graph-neighbor RRF, optional
vector RRF, and bounded raw-observation fallback.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the data-flow
diagram, crate breakdown, schema notes, and invariants.

## Influences and prior art

- **[Karpathy LLM Wiki](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f)** - the compile-not-retrieve pattern.
- **[agentmemory](https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory)** - most of the right ideas; this project is the Rust successor.
- **[basic-memory](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory)** - the markdown-on-disk source-of-truth model.
- **[cognee](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee)** - pipeline composition and triplet embeddings.
- **[A-MEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12110)** - Zettelkasten-style atomic notes with link evolution.
